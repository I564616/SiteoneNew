The Order Acknowledgement will be provided by SiteOne upon receipt of the Customer’s purchase order or response to SiteOne’s quote if SiteOne accepts the respective order. Customer will also receive an email order confirmation, receipt, and “ready for pick-up/delivery” email when the respective order is ready. Once an Order Acknowledgement has been provided by SiteOne, all such accepted orders are non-cancellable and non-refundable. Prices and delivery dates stated on any Order Acknowledgment shall prevail in the event of a discrepancy between it and the Customer’s written order; provided that, Customer acknowledges and agrees that any such delivery dates are estimates only and will not be binding upon SiteOne. Customer acknowledges and agrees that some orders may require a deposit or downpayment before SiteOne will process the order. The respective deposit amount will be collected at the time of order submission. If the Customer cancels the respective order, SiteOne may elect, in its sole discretion, to retain the deposit amount in its entirety, and Customer acknowledges and agrees that, if SiteOne elects to retain the deposit, the respective deposit amount will be forfeited and non-refundable. If SiteOne cancels the order, SiteOne will refund the deposit amount to Customer. SiteOne determines the amount of the deposit at the time of purchase, which may range from ten percent (10%) to one hundred percent (100%) of the respective order total. Orders may be placed through SiteOne’s customer account portal (the “Portal”), whereby Customer may be required to create a login and password to access such Portal and place orders therein. Customer represents and warrants that Customer will use a unique username and password to access the Portal. Customer is responsible for keeping its username and password confidential and is responsible for all uses of Customer’s account. To maintain account security, SiteOne recommends that Customer changes its password regularly and whenever Customer reasonably believes that its password may have been compromised. Customer must immediately notify SiteOne of any unauthorized access to Customer’s account, or if Customer suspects that its account has been compromised. SiteOne will not manage or have access to Customer’s password, so SiteOne is unable to retrieve the password if misplaced. Customer agrees that it is responsible for any misuse of its account, even if Customer is unaware of the misuse. Customer may also be liable to us or third parties for any misuse of the Portal through its account. Customer may not use anyone else’s account unless Customer has obtained such party or individual’s prior, written consent. For the sake of clarity, Customer may also place orders as a guest without creating an account. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><br /><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""tab-stops:list .5in""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif""><strong>3.

Customer acknowledges and agrees that any such Promotional Offerings are offers only and are not considered a sale or completed transaction unless customer pays for such Promotional Offerings at the time the order is placed by using a valid credit card. Promotional Offerings are subject to a close-by date, to be selected by SiteOne in its sole discretion, which is the date by which the Promotional Offerings must be paid for in full by customer, otherwise customer will be responsible for remitting the full, non-discounted purchase price for the respective Products. For example, if a Black Friday sale offers a 25% discount and has a close-by date of December 15th, all Promotional Offerings must be paid for in full by customer by December 15th, or the customer will forfeit the respective 25% discount and customer will be responsible for the entire purchase price of the respective Products and the Promotional Offering will be removed and void. Promotional Offerings are available for online purchase only. SiteOne may discontinue or revise Promotional Offerings at any time without notice. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><br /><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""tab-stops:list .5in""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif""><strong>4.

Prices are subject to adjustment without notice to conform to prices in effect on the date of order shipment and apply only to the specific Products ordered. All the pricing provided in SiteOne’s quote and/or Order Acknowledgment is based on the assumption that SiteOne’s raw material (including compounds), energy, labor, and transportation costs (including tariffs/duties) will remain relatively stable for the duration of the shipments. SiteOne reserves the right to modify prices for accepted purchase orders upon a material increase in any of such costs and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith any such price increases.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><br /><strong><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""tab-stops:list .5in""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">5.

A FINANCE CHARGE OF THE LESSER OF 1.5% PER MONTH OR THAT WHICH IS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL BE ADDED TO THE UNPAID BALANCE ON ALL ACCOUNTS NOT PAID IN FULL ON OR BEFORE THE DUE DATE. THE MAXIMUM FINANCE CHARGE IS EQUIVALENT TO AN ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE OF 18%.

Delivery dates specified on the Order Acknowledgment are approximate only. SiteOne’s responsibility for transportation shall be limited to shipping Products to Customer. All costs of delivery are the responsibility of Customer and are in addition to the fees due for the Product. Customer is responsible for making independent arrangements and for contacting Customer’s sales representative for a delivery quotation. Due to circumstances beyond SiteOne’s control, many jobsite deliveries are not able to be serviced directly by SiteOne, and LTL orders on fragile items may not be accepted. Any excess costs for transportation, including special handling costs, will be charged to the Customer, in addition to above-mentioned prices. Risk of loss, damage, and title transfers pursuant to the INCOTERMS (2010) or shipping terms applicable for each Product shipment, which may be set forth in the Order Acknowledgement; provided, if the foregoing are not determinable, then risk of loss, damage, and title transfer once tendered by SiteOne to the applicable carrier. Other than any express, limited warranty claims, where applicable and offered, Customer may have related to a Product, all Customer acceptance claims must be received by SiteOne in writing, within five (5) days from date of delivery.
