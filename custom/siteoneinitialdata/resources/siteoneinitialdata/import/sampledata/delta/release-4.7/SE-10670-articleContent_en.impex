You can even find some that automatically gauge the wire diameter so you never need to worry about stripping any interior wire from the bundle.</p><p>2. <strong>Crimp tool</strong> &ndash; Use to simultaneously combine the individual wires you&rsquo;ve exposed during stripping so the connection can be made and electrical current can flow through the fixture(s).</p><p>3. <strong><a href=""https://www.siteone.com/en/4327-nebo-nebo-socketscrewdriver-set-pressure-range-color-dimensions-/p/440326"" target=""_blank"">6-in-1 Screwdriver</a></strong>&nbsp;- Reduce the number of trips back and forth to your truck or toolbox with multi-use tips that fit all of the standard screw types. You&rsquo;ll be using this for just about every lighting install, so look for models with a comfortable grip and a secure connection mechanism between the attachable tips and handle.&nbsp;</p><p>4. <strong>Silicone filled connectors</strong> &ndash; Seen as one of the more reliable lighting connector types, this component typically consists of two parts: &nbsp;a cap that combines the cut ends of wire and a separate, silicone gel-filled cover that keeps the cap in place and prevents moisture intrusion. &nbsp;</p><p>5. <strong>12 Gauge low voltage landscaping wire</strong> &ndash; To determine how much wiring you will need, consider the run length or distances between your transformer and the locations of your fixtures. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also smart to add extra wire (typically ~3ft) at each fixture in the event you want to move your lights as plantings mature or additional hardscape features are added. &nbsp;</p><p>6. <strong>Voltmeter voltage detector</strong> &ndash; Use this tool to determine if you&rsquo;re connected to the proper voltage tap on your transformer and trouble-shoot issues as needed. &nbsp;The voltage range to field wires (those running between fixtures) should be 9-15v for LED fixtures and 10-12v for halogen lamps. &nbsp;If you find the Voltmeter reading below the minimums for your fixture type connect your main supply wire to the higher voltage transformer tap. &nbsp;</p><p>7. <strong>Wire and edging trencher</strong>- This specialized, flat shovel that allows you to dig shallow trenches for wiring (6&rdquo;-8&rdquo;deep). &nbsp;This will help make your install faster and easier as you won&rsquo;t be exerting energy digging any deeper than needed. &nbsp;The objective is to protect the wire by burying it a few inches underground.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on the nature of the job there may be other accessories and tools useful for your install. &nbsp;For example, running wiring through buried PVC conduit can be helpful in areas around edging where digging is anticipated. &nbsp;<a href=""https://www.siteone.com/en/lighting/c/sh11"" target=""_blank"">Shop SiteOne Staged</a> or ask a SiteOne Associate at your local branch about the other lighting accessories and tools most suited to your lighting project.</p></div>";Essential-Tools-For-Landscape-Lighting-Installation-ParagraphComponent

Good objections aren't they? But one of the six basic objections that is the most telling in our industry is the perceived need. How often do you hear potential customers tell you that a landscape lighting system is a luxury not a need?</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Do you perceive a need? When was the last time you approached a job site and informed your client that you could address these three basic concerns with landscape lighting? When is the last time you thought about why people need landscape lighting?</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Let's discuss the first major need for landscape lighting security concerns. If you don't think people are willing to pay for a certain degree of security start taking notice of the proliferation of companies that are servicing the home security market. Start noticing how many yard signs are in front of homes today warning possible intruders that the home is protected with a security system. If there are six homes on the street and only one is completely lit with landscape lighting which house is an intruder least likely to pursue? With landscape lighting the prowler sees the security sign from the street. Effectively constructing and designing a landscape lighting system that takes into account each concern beauty safety and security will be very effective in providing ample protection and security to your customers.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>If you still don't believe your customers don't have a need for the security lighting you can provide ask yourself how many of your customers have porch lights? How many would leave that on at night?</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>With a landscape lighting system your customers get not only security but the safety elements are addressed. Changes in the elevation low level shrubs or plant material that people may trip over all are potential safety concerns that need to be addressed for the homeowner and his guests. Changes in the steps the deck the driveway the entrance ways all of these potential safety hazards and more can be addressed with landscape lighting. And by building in the proper controls for your customer with their landscape lighting system safety concerns can be ""turned on"" with motion sensing devices timers and more to give your customer comfort knowing that his family and visitors are able to avoid accidents.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>As you can see landscape lighting systems may fulfill more actual client needs than many other offerings being made in our industry today. If you can effectively present to your clients how you can address some security and safety concerns with landscape lighting you're 90 percent on your way to a sale. That's because the easy part and by far the biggest added value of a landscape lighting system is the beauty aspect. Most of us focus first on beauty in landscape lighting and dramatically diminish the safety and security issues so much that we also begin to believe in the myth that landscape lighting is a luxury. You have to believe and with good reason that an effective landscape lighting system fulfills some basic overall needs that every client you have wants to be fulfilled.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Being able to effectively present this to your clients goes a long way toward overcoming the most often-stated objection to landscape lighting.

Nothing can help your referrals more than an effective landscape lighting system. It will not only expand the living space for your clients it will give them year-round access and enjoyment to their landscape investment. In Michigan where you only have abundant daytime light from late April to late September landscape lighting's role in keeping your customers satisfied is even more dramatic. Consider Joe Homeowner who just made a large investment in his landscape. When is he going to really get to enjoy it? A couple months out of the year at best if there isn't landscape lighting. For a fraction of the total cost of landscape installation landscape lighting will allow your customers to benefit from the safety and security aspects of landscape lighting and enjoy the beauty that you brought to them for an entire season.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>To overcome each of the basic six objections that are in every sales presentation first overcome your own misconceptions.

Outdoor audio is another new and rapidly growing category that pairs well with lighting installation. There are substantial opportunities in each of these areas because of the low penetration rate. Fewer than 10% of all existing single family detached homes have landscape lighting and fewer than 2% have outdoor audio. It&rsquo;s worth noting the audio offering now available is far superior to the &ldquo;speaker rocks&rdquo; which may come to mind.</p><p>What do you need to know to get started?</p><ol style=""list-style-type:decimal""><li><strong>Get Quality Installation Training.</strong> It&rsquo;s important to have some level of professional training. Lighting and outdoor audio installations are easy for pros but homeowners and novices find it challenging. Like irrigation installation both landscape lighting and outdoor audio systems are low voltage so the safety risks are less than with traditional voltage installations. However some markets do require a licensed electrician to finalize the installation but that isn&rsquo;t common and shouldn&rsquo;t deter you from entering the market. Investing time and energy in quality training upfront will pay off in terms of work quality and confidence.</li><li><strong>Develop Brand and Product Expertise.</strong> Get comfortable with the brands and styles best suited for your local area and the type of work you&rsquo;re offering. SiteOne can connect you with top vendors and provide local expertise to help understand how to select the right product for the job.</li><li><strong>Grow Local.</strong> Some consider lighting an art form where you paint your canvas with light. Being able to highlight the key attributes of someone&rsquo;s home is critical to the homeowner&rsquo;s satisfaction and subsequent referrals. Trees bushes gables columns pathways dormers and outdoor living spaces are all important focus areas of the palette to consider illuminating. SiteOne can help you develop a better understanding of this concept which will help you grow. Remember it&rsquo;s light to see not to see by.</li><li><strong>Set Appropriate Spec and Pricing.</strong> As a contractor understanding what the homeowner wants is vital and will allow you to offer the right product at the right price. How you price your services will depend on a number of factors but landscape lighting has a healthy margin. Outdoor audio is also a rapidly growing new category with tremendous revenue and profit opportunities.</li></ol><p>SiteOne Landscape Supply can help at every stage of the process.

These services can include cleaning and storing patio furniture for homeowners	 repairing cracked concrete (pavers or slabs) so that water freeze-thaw cycle doesn&rsquo;t make the crack worse	 addressing soil compaction leading to sunken pavers (uneven surfaces can hinder snow and ice removal)	 and pressure washing.<br /></li><li>Add more sand between the joints of brick or concrete paver surfaces. This will reduce shifting	 help hold the pavers in place	 and allow for proper drainage after snow melt or rain.<br /></li><li>Choose ice-melt wisely. Some chemicals in deicers can cause damage to pavers and plants. Try using calcium-based ice melts. Calcium-based ice melts tend to have fewer negative side effects compared to some of the blends with more chemicals in them.<br /></li><li>Check for existing drainage issues. If pools of water sit in driveways and sidewalks after summer rains	 then these areas will likely cause even more trouble in icy conditions.<br /></li><li>Stock up on the winter snow and ice removal tools like snow plows	 snow shovels	 and snow pushers before the season begins. Don&rsquo;t wait for a weather event or you could be out of tools (and luck) when your customers need you.

Hardscape projects like paver patios	 segmented retaining walls	 water features	 fire pits	 walk ways	 driveways	 and built-in kitchens provide tools for commercial and residential customers to maximize every square foot of their living/working space. What has changed are the trends and tools available to hardscapes contractors. Below is our recap of hardscapes industry trends from the last Hardscapes North America Show:</p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>Hardscapes Industry Trends:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Virtual reality (VR) visualization tools</strong>- VR has been an emerging technology for design	 architecture	 and real estate businesses for the last few years. Now that the costs of the technologies have come down suppliers are integrating VR tools into their landscape project planning services. Viewing 3D renderings in VR through tools like the Belgard Design Studio leads to happier clients and increased closure rates for contractors because customers can see the finished project before the first paver is physically laid; this helps minimize the sometimes gray area of translating design from 2D to reality. <br /></li><li><strong>Permeable pavers</strong>- Unique designs by suppliers like Belgard and their Aqualine Series <a href=""/en/hardscapes-outdoor-living-stones-pavers-edging/c/sh1514"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">Permeable Paver</a> help manage runoff by allowing storm water to pass through the material and directly absorb into the ground or be gathered and recycled for irrigation. Contractors can expect to see supplier offerings expand as more and more consumers become interested in hardscaping materials that can help with water capture	 storage and reuse.<br /></li><li><strong>New paver textures and </strong><strong>shapes</strong>- Gone are the days of only rectangular pavers. The myriad of hardscapes vendors at this year’s HNA show indicated consumers’ demand for eclectic paver design and texture options.  Whether it’s the feel of cobble stone or <a href=""https://www.turfmagazine.com/hardscapes/creative-artistic-paver-installations/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">eye-catching laying patterns</a>	 paver design options are showing up everywhere and only limited by the designer’s imagination and project budget. <br /></li><li><strong>Ancillary systems</strong>-  As components like water features and outdoor seating areas remain popular	 ancillary systems like outdoor audio and<a href=""/en/lighting/c/sh11"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline""> landscape lighting</a> continue to expand. In the spirt of making tools more efficient	 contractors can also expect to see advancements in smart lighting and controls to help save customers time and money over the life of these systems. </li></ul><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Labor concerns and lack of knowledge can sometimes hamper contractors from adding hardscapes to their services lineup; however	 manufacturers are continually improving material options to reduce the expertise	 labor	 and time required to successfully complete hardscapes projects.

One way to capitalize on the growth of this sector, while keeping labor challenges in mind, is for landscape and irrigation contractors to offer hardscaping as an additional service and look for opportunities to do more at every jobsite. For example, just about every hardscape installation requires some form of drainage solution.</p><p>During the past year, many stories have surfaced regarding the lack of labor in landscaping markets. Some contractors reported turning away hundreds of thousands of dollars in new business because they didn&#39;t have the crews and/or couldn&#39;t find local labor to hire.</p><p>Unfortunately, the labor shortage is happening at the same time as substantial growth in the industry. According to the Freedonia Group</p><p>, the landscape products market in the U.S. is estimated to grow 5.3% annually through 2019 to an estimated $8.2 billion. Much of this anticipated growth will be driven by residential homeowners upping the curb appeal of their homes, and for many homes across the country, this translates to consideration of a hardscape project.</p><p>It&#39;s clear that a business opportunity exists, but how can contractors take advantage of it without hiring new personnel and without highly skilled labor?</p><p>Newer products on the market, like Satura from Belgard</p><p>are changing the dynamics of the hardscape labor force and market. By offering manufactured stone products, these companies make hardscapes easier to install, meaning less crew training is required while providing many of the natural stone looks that clients desire at a lower price point. Depending on a number of factors, manufactured stone is typically half to one-third the price of natural stone. This translates to a business opportunity for landscape contractors to train their existing crew to install manufactured hardscape products and offer this service to their existing customer base. Other labor-saving products, like Alliance Gator Base or super sacks to transport aggregates, can also help reduce labor demands.</p><p>Where to begin with hardscapes:</p><ul><li><strong>Knowledge.</strong> While installation is a relatively simple process, it&#39;s still important to get professional training either from the manufacturer or your supplier. SiteOne offers training for contractors who want to learn hardscape installation. By leveraging on-staff experts and inside knowledge from product manufacturers, SiteOne offers a comprehensive education in hardscaping.</li><li><strong>Tools.</strong> While many contractors have the tools necessary to do the work, some specialty tools and equipment may be needed. As a contractor gets started in the business, renting the right equipment can help speed up the job.</li>	<li><strong>Safety.</strong> It&#39;s always important to keep safety in mind. If you&#39;re cutting stone, your crew may be using different tools than normal, so training and proper safety equipment are important. Also, ensure that all crew members know how to properly lift and move heavy objects to avoid injury.</li></ul><p>As always, working with a supplier that understands your local market and specific business needs can be invaluable. To learn more about offering hardscape services next season, ask your local SiteOne representative by visiting&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""/store-finder"">your nearest SiteOne branch</a>&nbsp;or Hardscape Center.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>";Grow-Your-Business-By-Adding-Hardscape-Services-ParagraphComponent

Statistics like these along with stricter local watering regulations and increased demands on water supply reiterate the importance of understanding your irrigation options especially when it comes to spray heads.</p><p>Updated spray head offerings typically include high efficiency features such as pressure regulators flow restriction devices and check valves. Read on for a description of these important components and the benefits for customers who elect new systems to make their existing irrigation systems more efficient.</p><p><strong>Pressure Regulators</strong></p><p>Pressure regulators are helpful on sites with high water pressure or those on a downward slope. These components typically reduce water pressure to 30psi which can result in as much as a 30% water savings.</p><p><strong>Flow Restriction Devices</strong></p><p>Found inside of high efficiency spray heads these devices reduce the flow rate to the riser or completely shut off the water if a nozzle is broken or missing. Some flow restriction devices even have the ability to generate a tall indicator stream if a nozzle is compromised increasing the chance of a timely repair and reducing the amount of water leaked.</p><p><strong>Check Valves:</strong></p><p>Similar to pressure regulators check valves&nbsp;are useful on sloped sites or those prone to draining out. In areas of elevation change these devices keep water flowing the way the system design intended. Depending on the degree of slope check valves can produce as much as 20 gallons of water savings per minute.</p><p>Each year The Irrigation Association hosts Smart Irrigation Month to educate professionals and consumers about the many benefits of efficient irrigation technologies products and services in the green industry.

This way, controllers like <a href=""/esp4mei-rain-bird-modular-wifi-smart-controller-esp-me-indoor-4-stat/p/492222"">Rain Bird’s ESP-ME</a> can be set to split run times into safe chunks of time to preserve the land and minimize erosion while meeting vegetation needs. Controllers with advanced features like Cycle+Soak<sup>TM</sup> will split runtimes automatically.</p><p><strong>Tip #2</strong><br />Site plans often don’t show how much ground slopes cover accurately, which can cause confusion and mistakes. Be sure to account for the slope’s range as you lay down lateral lines. For reference, a properly adjusted sprinkler throws around 80% of its radius above the head, and 120% below the head on a 2:1 slope (Rain Bird). Compensate for the effects of the slope by reducing the space between the middle and bottom lateral lines; these should be moved closer towards the top of the slope. <br /><br />Additionally, lateral lines should follow the slope’s contours. Space the lines across the slope instead of with it. If installed incorrectly in a top-down formation, the pressure differential from the elevation change can generate uneven pressures at the sprinklers which can cause uneven water distribution. Higher pressures can build at the bottom of the slope and can damage the system.</p><p><strong>Tip #3</strong><br />As an insurance policy, use a master valve, pressure regulators, and flow sensing equipment.<br /><br /><a href=""/irrigation-valves/c/sh1431110?q=%3Arelevance%3AsoproductBrandNameFacet%3ARain%2BBird&amp;searchtype=product&amp;viewtype=All&amp;Brand=on#"">Master valves</a> are especially important for sloped irrigation as it acts as a back-up to shut off water supply. Install this at the water source to reduce the pressure on the mainline. The controller can open and close the master valve, and it’s on when zones are watering the landscape. When closed, the master valve will ensure there is no running water through the system. If using flow sensing equipment, the master valve will shut of the system and close if there are issues like the mainline bursting, leaks in the lines, malfunctioning sprinklers, or other causes of damaging erosion. <br /><br />Install a high-flow/low-flow pressure device with a flow sensor at the source also. Ensure the flow capacity is the same as the largest flow demand. This flow sensing equipment can detect excessively high flows, normally caused by issues like a pipe break. If installed properly, the use of this with a master valve will significantly reduce damage to the landscape.<br /><br /><a href=""/psim40x075-nla-rain-bird-medium-flow-pressure-regulator-inline-2-10-gpm-34-/p/87847"">Pressure regulators</a> will ensure landscaping will receive the best sprinkler coverage. Built-in pressure compensating or regulating devices such as the 1800-PRS and 5000+PRS provide the best option since the optimum operating pressure is delivered directly to each sprinkler head. Nozzles that run at the optimum pressure are more efficient, and often sprinklers that run at non-uniform and non-optimum pressures can cause flora to deteriorate.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Tip #4</strong><br />Protect landscaping with reverse-flow valves and check valves. <br /><br />Reverse flow valves will prevent water from free flowing through the pipes if there is a problem or break. Without this, there could be challenging erosion issues from continuously running water through a broken system.<br /><br />Ensure you install sprinklers with check valves as another safeguard. Check valves contain the water in the lateral lines when the zone’s watering cycle is complete. If there aren’t check valves in place, the slope could cause enough pressure to force water from the nozzles, causing erosion and runoff issues. Choosing sprinkler heads with integrated check valves eliminates the need to install check valves separately. <br /><br />Driplines can also be installed for controlled release watering with minimal erosion.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Tip #5</strong><br />Consider valve zones carefully.<br /><br />Limit sprinkler heads on a valve zone to increase performance and minimize risk of damage. Ensure the amount of sprinkler heads and pressure is correct for each hydrozone’s watering needs and climatic exposures. Too many sprinkler heads in one zone means more water flow during system failure and depending on zone needs could mean overwatering. <br /><br />Additionally, to ensure uniform water distribution, separate full-circle and part-circle sprinklers and adjust station run times as needed. Consider using nozzle sets that create consistent precipitation rates by design despite different arc and radii ranges to reduce different water pressures and flow across a zone, therefore reducing erosion risk. Because many slopes are planted with ground cover instead of turf, consider installing highly efficient XFS-CV Check Valve Dripline which offers controlled release watering to help eliminate runoff and encourage healthy root growth. Not only will the landscape dripline improve the visual impact of the site, it isn&#39;t visible, and may help cut down on vandalism.<br /><br /><em>*This article first appeared on the <a href=""https://www.rainbird.com/professionals/dealing-slope-irrigation"" target=""_blank"">Rain Bird Resource Library</a>.</em> </p></div>";Slope-Irrigation-Tips-ParagraphComponent

Well here is a way to separate yourself from the competition and save the homeowner money. How? By charging more. Yes by charging more.</p><p>Now before you say we&#39;re crazy let us explain. How can you charge more money and still save the homeowner money? By installing better products that save the homeowner money in the long run.</p><h3>Better Products Use Less Water</h3><p>You can easily save your customer 15 gallons of water per sprinkler per week. And this is a conservative number. 15 gallons per sprinkler per week means a great deal of water conservation and puts money back in the pocket of the homeowner. Today most customers will jump at the chance to save 15 gallons of water. Also most cities charge for water usage and water disposal or sewer. Thus the customer can save twice as much money (once on the use and once on the sewer). And the best part is you can confidently charge your customers more for these efficient smart improvements.</p><p>One product that can help customers save this much water: pressure regulating spray heads. By reducing the pressure from 40 PSI to 30 PSI on a 15&#39; radius half-pattern spray head with an average run time of 60 minutes per week pressure regulating spray heads will easily save 15 gallons per week per sprinkler. Remember this is based upon reducing the pressure only by 10 PSI. And this a conservative number &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; imagine the savings with a 20 or 30 PSI reduction.</p><p>Let&#39;s work through a typical small residential installation. Suppose you are bidding a job that will have 10 spray heads. Each product will be a 15&#39; radius half pattern spray head. Each will run 1 hour a week. This will be a savings of 15 gallons per sprinkler times 10 sprinklers which equals 150 gallons of water per week. Now multiply this by how many weeks a year you irrigate.</p><p>If you want to work out different scenarios please visit <a href=""https://www.rainbird.com/professionals/calculators"" target=""_blank"">Rain Bird&#39;s water savings calculators</a>.</p><p>Installing pressure-regulating spray heads is one of the simplest ways to save your homeowner customers money. It takes no additional labor to install and it sells itself to the customer. Imagine telling the homeowner &quot;You will save 15 gallons per week per sprinkler compared to my competitor&#39;s bid of using traditional non-pressure regulating spray heads.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a win-win situation for everyone.</p></div>";Happy-Customers-Pay-More-ParagraphComponent

The system design should be driven by player and user safety as well as the need for dependability efficiency and easy maintenance.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>It may be tempting to employ the services of a volunteer designer for an irrigation project. But an experienced institutional or sports field irrigation design professional or consultant will usually allow the turf manager to save both time and money in the long run. Designing an effective system requires knowledge of pipe hydraulics zoning techniques head spacing wire sizing and the efficiency features and reliability of various rotary sprinklers valves and controllers. The cost to repair a single error in any of these areas can easily be higher than the fee charged by an experienced designer.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>In planning a system the designer will give a great deal of consideration to choosing the most appropriate equipment since each sports field project has its own specific product and budget requirements. Placement of the heads and valves will also be a major consideration and the designer will space the heads so they are not in heavy traffic areas and the valves are well off the field of play.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Pipe</h3><p>The pipe running from the irrigation system's point of connection (POC) into the service line to the zone control valves is called the ""continuous pressure main line"" or simply ""main line"". It is a common practice to use solvent welded PVC pipe at a depth of 18 inches below the surface for pipe sizes up to 4 inches and 24 inches below the surface for pipes larger than 4 inches. Gasketed pipe is sometimes specified and should be placed deeper; 36 inches under the surface for pipes larger than 4 inches is usually considered reasonable. However higher system pressures may lead the designer to specify deeper installation to hold the pipe securely in place.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>The non-pressure pipes which connect the control valves to the sprinkler heads are referred to as ""lateral lines."" These lines can be installed at a depth of 12 inches which is standard for the industry.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>The backfill surrounding the pipe should be rock-free and compacted to the same degree as the neighboring soil. The rock-free backfill will help prevent pipe breakage and the consistent compaction will prevent ruts in the turf that are caused by the uneven settling of the soil over the pipe trench.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Poured-in-place concrete ""thrust blocks"" are sometimes specified where pipe connections must be especially solid. For instance thrust blocks are typically specified at all changes in direction on all gasketed pipe for main line pipes over 2"" in diameter and on long runs when the system will have higher-than-normal pressure.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Specifying the proper pipe sizes helps maintain the correct water velocity and minimizes friction losses throughout the system. Water flowing through pipes experiences considerable drag or friction from the pipe itself; when the velocity of the water increases the pressure loss from friction increases. If the pipe used for the system is too small the operating pressure will be much lower for the heads at the end of the zone than for the heads closest to the valve serving that zone. Irrigation designers agree that there should be no more than a 10% variation in pressure among all heads on a zone.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Most institutional and sports field irrigation system designs show a looped main line. Designers also like to maintain about the same pressure from one zone to another. The reduced pressure loss experienced when the water is flowing from two directions in a looped main line helps them achieve a relatively balanced pressure throughout the main line at a reduced cost. The designer would have to size the pipe larger with a single connection main line than is necessary with the looped system. This smaller pipe size saves money while reducing the pressure loss to the furthest valve.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>PVC pipe is also used as sleeves for the irrigation system's pipes and wires where they pass under walkways driveways and roads. A good rule of thumb for sleeve sizing is two times the size of the pipe being sleeved.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Sprinklers Nozzles and Swing Joints</h3><p>The sprinkler head consists of three major components: the main body of the device the nozzles through which water flows out of the body and the swing joint at the bottom of the body which maintains the sprinkler's connection to the lateral lines.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Sprinkler heads have been gradually downsized over the years primarily for safety purposes. Newer heads have a small surface diameter and a protective thick rubber cover which makes them a very safe alternative to the older-style sprinklers.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Additionally many of the newer heads have a strong spring for positive retraction so the head will not endanger the public by staying in the up position after the watering is completed. Many of today's safer heads also have a heavy-duty body cap to stand up to the large equipment now being used in routine maintenance. Most gear-driven rotary sprinkler heads should be installed right at the finish grade of the turf.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Designers also prefer a rotary sprinkler with a large nozzle selection. The nozzle is chosen to fine-tune the flow of water out of the system. The experienced irrigation system designer will use correct nozzle sizes to obtain matched precipitation (the precipitation rate for sprinkler systems is the rate expressed in inches per hour at which water is applied over the surface of the turf). Matched precipitation means the entire field is receiving about the same amount of water.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Swing joints can be fabricated on-site by the installers of the system or can be manufactured parts provided by the supplier. A three-elbow double swing joint will perform efficiently if fabricated correctly. Manufactured double swing joints with o-ring seals cut down on installation time and are often more dependable. Correctly installed a double-swing joint provides flexibility and resists breakage when large mowers or other heavy equipment rolls over the sprinkler.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Valves</h3><p>In an irrigation system there are two basic types of valves: shut-off valves and sprinkler valves. Shut-off valves (""gate valves"" or ""ball valves"") are used in a continuous pressure main line to temporarily turn the water off to the entire system or a section of the system. Sprinkler valves (manual or automatic) are used to deliver the water from the continuous pressure main line to the sprinklers. In the discussion of sprinkler systems when the term valve is used alone it usually refers to an automatic control valve.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Gate valves have a wheel type handle and several turns of the handle are required to turn off the flow of water. Gate valves are most commonly used on main line pipes with high water pressure or high water flow. Because several turns are required they are easier to turn off and the potential for damage caused by water hammer is reduced. Gate valves have a brass-to-brass seat which means that they may eventually lose their secure seal. For this reason gate valves are not recommended for frequent use.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Ball valves have a single arm or lever that requires one-quarter turn to turn on or off. This single action is convenient but caution should be used and the valve should not be turned on or off too quickly because damage to the system from water hammer could result. Ball valves have resilient seats which maintain their ability to seal longer than brass-to-brass seats making ball valves a better choice than gate valves where frequent use is expected.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Among sprinkler valves manual control valves are not as common as they once were. The manually controlled sprinkler system requires an operator to time the irrigation of each zone and to turn valves on and off at the proper time. The operator must be present the entire time the system is operating. Obviously this type of system does not have the convenience of the automatic system.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Automatic control valves are used in conjunction with automatic controllers or timers and are a much more convenient way to deliver water to the turf. Because these valves can be more precisely controlled an automatic system allows the sports turf manager to efficiently schedule the delivery of the right amount of water to each zone.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>There are many types of automatic control valves. On systems not connected directly to city water systems choose a valve with an inexpensive self cleaning filtering mechanism. Because of the possibility of higher surge pressure in a large turf system it is recommended that the valve be able to withstand pressures up to 200 PSI. A pressure regulator can be installed at the beginning of the system but with the long main line and the potential for high friction loss it is generally better to have an automatic control valve with a built-in pressure regulator and control the pressure right at the valve.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Placement of the valves should be planned with maintenance and safety in mind. Automatic control valves are generally installed in groups or manifolds and placed underground in a plastic or concrete valve box. If the valves will be near the field of play use plastic. The manifolds should be built with plenty of room between valves. The distance between valves is dependent on the size of the valve box; for most standard size boxes two or three 1"" valves can be installed in a valve box while valves larger than 1"" are usually installed one valve per box.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Controllers</h3><p>The controller (or ""timer"") is the part of an automatic sprinkler system that determines when a valve will turn on and how long the valve will operate. The controller sends a low voltage signal through buried wires to the automatic control valve which then opens for a predetermined amount of time allowing water to flow to the sprinklers. When the predetermined watering time is completed the controller turns off the valve.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>A controller should be chosen for its wide range of programming capabilities as well as other convenience features. A non-volatile memory means the controller will not lose the program due to power outages or surges. Surge protection will protect the controller from serious damage due to nearby lightning strikes or power surges.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Controllers should be placed in an easily accessible location in a lockable room or waterproof enclosure. In considering the controller it is important to remember that some systems require a pump to maintain adequate water pressure. Be sure the controller chosen for this type of system includes a pump start feature. If a pump is needed the two pieces of equipment are typically placed in the same enclosure. However the controller should use a separate electrical circuit to reduce the possibility of damage to the controller due to power surges.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>As with any electrical equipment to prevent injury from high voltage electrical shock it is essential to specify that a proper ground wire be installed to the controller. Consult local codes for the grounding requirements in a specific area.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Wires</h3><p>In an automatic sprinkler system low voltage direct burial wire is used to carry the signal from the controller to the automatic control valves. The most frequently used wire for commercial applications is single strand heavy gauge direct burial copper wire. A lighter gauge wire can be used when installing valves close to the controller but heavier gauge wire is necessary for longer distances and may be necessary even for short distances on higher pressure systems. An irrigation designer or consultant will specify the necessary wire size when designing the system.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Many specifiers recommend that the wire be buried in the same trench as the main line taped to the under side of the pipe. This will help to protect the wire and make it easier to locate. Furthermore a wire taped to the pipe can serve as a tracer wire to locate the main line should it become necessary to do so.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Wherever control wire will be exposed it should be installed in a protective conduit. Waterproof wire connectors should be used to connect the solenoid wires to the low voltage irrigation wire. Where permitted by local code wire nuts can be used for connections not exposed to moisture.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Backflow Prevention</h3><p>In order to protect the potable (drinking) water supply from contamination most states and municipalities require the installation of backflow prevention devices on all plumbing systems that are connected to the public water supply. These devices prevent water from the system from flowing backward into the supply lines. In planning or installing an institutional or sports field irrigation system the designer should consult with the local water company to determine the backflow devices required and their proper installation.</p></div>";Institutional-Irrigation-Systems-ParagraphComponent

;;Winterizing-An-Irrigation-System-ParagraphComponent;"<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p> <img src=""/medias/sys_master/images/images/h1f/hd4/8796180938782/Winterizing-an-Irrigation-System-P8A0631-2.jpg"" alt=""Winterizing an Irrigation System"" height=""auto"" width=""100%""></p><br/>Each year when the leaves start to fall and temperatures drop we know it's time to shut down irrigation systems. In the colder climates irrigation systems must be winterized to avoid damage caused by freezing temperatures. By taking the necessary steps to protect irrigation systems now you can avoid costly repairs in the spring.</p><p>First there are some claims of irrigation systems being self-draining. This might be true however is it worth the gamble? Drains can get clogged or forgotten to be opened or water can be trapped in low spots. For the added safety and fairly low cost of winterizing with an air compressor it's not worth the gamble. Blowing out an irrigation system with an air compressor has been proven to be the best method in use today.</div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">The following is the procedure for winterizing a typical irrigation system. Throughout the country the products and scenarios may differ but generally the sequence of procedures remains the same.</p><p>First and foremost turn off the water! There will always be a master shut off valve somewhere. The basement crawl space or utility room would be the first place to check. Turn it off and tag it for future reference. Placing a tag on the valve indicating it's for the irrigation system will prevent any mishaps that could happen for an unknowing homeowner.</div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">Next manually drain the system (as much as possible). This will alleviate the pressure in the system and give you a head start on the winterizing process. Usually opening a hose bib or drain on the backflow preventer will do nicely. Sometimes there is a drain inside the house. Don't forget to use a bucket to catch any drained water. Warning you might get wet. Opening a drain under pressure will shoot water out for the first few seconds until the pressure locked in the system dies down.</div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">Once the pressure has been bled from the system and the water has drained down a little it's time to hook up the compressor.</p><p>The compressor size being used should depend on the system size. Usually bigger is better (and faster). A smaller compressor can work but it might take a while. Recommended compressors should deliver a minimum of 60 psi at 15 cubic feet per minute (CFM). This is what actually displaces the water. Most compressors will not have a problem delivering the psi but it's the CFM's where they might lack.</div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">Find an access to the system where we can hook up the air compressor. There has to be a hose bib or a drain somewhere after the main shutoff valve where the compressor hose can be attached. It will probably be the same drain used in the previous step. Make sure all the other drains are closed (if you opened them in the previous step) except for the drain where the hose will be attached. Sometimes you have to use a little ingenuity to make up a fitting to attach the air hose to the drain. It's not usually a standard fitting (unless you're really lucky).</div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">Prior to hooking up the air hose to the irrigation system let the air compressor charge itself. Usually most compressors can charge up to 120 psi or more. However you do not need that much pressure to blow out a system. Actually never blow out an irrigation system with more than 80 psi. Be warned anything over 80 psi can damage the components of the irrigation system. A good rule of thumb is to use the same amount of pressure used for the house water pressure often around 60 psi. This will avoid any risks of using too much pressure.</div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">Now hook up the compressor and start winterizing. It's best to start with the zone furthest away and work your way back to the nearest zone. Or start on the zone at the highest elevation point usually on top of a berm or hill. For this example let's assume that zone number 10 is the furthest away. We turn zone number 10 on at the controller for 2 minutes and let it go. Now 2 minutes might be too long or not long enough. Watch the water as it comes out of the sprinkler heads. Slowly the water will turn into a mist then the mist will turn into air. At this point all the air is out of zone number 10. Turn off zone number 10 and continue on to the next zone.</div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">Please note you usually do not have to get every single drop of water out of the system. If you continue to blow out the system (even though all the water is out) heat from the air could damage the components of the irrigation system. It's better to get the majority of water out but not continuously run the compressor striving to get every drop of water out. A little residual water left in the zone will not hurt.</div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">It is recommended that you blow out each zone twice with two short cycles as opposed to blowing out each zone once with a long cycle. This reduces your margin of error because there is less of a chance that the compressor was left on too long or a zone was missed.</div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">Next we have to check the backflow preventer. Most systems have a backflow prevention device installed at the beginning of the system. Make sure it's completely void of water. You most likely we blew air through it in the previous steps. Open all the drains and leave them open. Over the winter it's best to leave the ball valves or drains (on the backflow preventer) at a 45-degree angle. Sometimes condensation can build up inside the ball valve cracking it when the temperature drops below the freezing point. Leaving the ball valves at a 45-degree angle will help prevent this.</div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">The average residential system should take about 30 to 45 minutes to winterize. But this could fluctuate depending on the size of the compressor being used and the size of the irrigation system. Obviously there are many more scenarios that can add to the winterization process. Pumps fertilizer injectors etc. could all add to the winterization process.</div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">Remember ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" This definitely applies to winterizing an irrigation system. Knowing that your customer's irrigation systems will start and operate without any headaches in the spring is definitely worth a pound of cure.</div>";Winterizing-An-Irrigation-System-ParagraphComponent

But as water management becomes a higher priority for local communities and homeowners it&#39;s a topic contractors working in the residential space must consider.</p><p>Some industry experts estimate that 97% of all existing homes have a recognizable stormwater management issue but only 30% of those issues are addressed. This means a large business opportunity exists for landscape contractors to offer stormwater management services.</p><p>Getting into the business isn&#39;t difficult; however it&#39;s important to be knowledgeable. Many homeowners start stormwater management projects but most aren&#39;t completed for two reasons:</p><ol style=""list-style-type:decimal""><li>The homeowner thinks the cost is too high or the contractor wasn&#39;t trained to do the work.</li><li>The problem is ignored or perceived as solved because it stops raining</li></ol><p>Here&#39;s what landscape contractors need to know to begin offering stormwater management services and address this significant customer need.</p><p><strong>Understand What Projects Create a Stormwater Management Need</strong><br />Typically any project that increases the impervious area of a landscape could trigger local stormwater management regulations. Know that any project that changes the landscape could also alter the existing water flow and create an opportunity for water management work.</p><p><strong>Know the Local Regulations</strong><br />There are currently no federal regulations on residential stormwater management. Most if not all regulations exist at the local level. Check with your local issuing authority to ask about regulations regarding permeability.</p><p><strong>Gain Knowledge</strong><br />NDS a leading supplier of water drainage solutions offers an excellent video series on water management and that&#39;s a great place to start. Once you have a basic understanding SiteOne offers water management courses as part of <a href=""/events"">SiteOne University</a> available through local SiteOne stores. Courses are available in the off-season and come to you courses may be available to larger contractors.</p><p><strong>Prepare for the Busy Season</strong><br />The busiest season for stormwater management aligns with a region&#39;s rainy season or spring thaw. This will vary depending on your area of the country. Contractors should consider adding water management to all their projects to eliminate unanticipated problems caused by improvements in the landscape.</p><p><strong>Gear Up</strong><br />One of the best parts about stormwater management services is that special tools aren&#39;t required. Most contractors already have what they need. Of course excavators and trenching machines can speed up larger jobs but this equipment can be rented at a reasonable cost.</p><p>To learn more about offering stormwater management services next season contact your local SiteOne representative or find your local SiteOne store using our <a href=""/store-finder"">location finder</a>.</p></div>";Stormwater-Management-ParagraphComponent

While an estimated 20 million+ US homes have irrigation systems installed many are out of date. For irrigation contractors this means the controller replacement market is quite large. </p><p>Wi-Fi-enabled controllers are relatively new to the market and in many ways are an extension of the smart home trend. Products available from Hunter Rain Bird Toro Hydro-Rain and Rachio offer an array of solutions for contractors where they can install homeowner-managed systems or manage these systems themselves as part of their service offering.</p><p>The benefits of replacing older controller models with new Wi-Fi-enabled models are clear:</p><h3>Refined Programming:</h3><p>Enhanced and remote programming options give users unprecedented control over their system which allows them to monitor and adjust their systems via their smart phone laptop or tablet.</p><h3>Smart Water Application:</h3><p>Smart technology saves water – up to 50% – and money by making predictive automatic watering adjustments. These adjustments can be based on local weather events and forecasts which may be automatically transmitted from local weather stations to individual controllers. Contractors and homeowners can also utilize on-site rain and moisture sensors that will further improve a systems efficiency.</p><h3>Easy Troubleshooting:</h3><p>For some models troubleshooting a system is much easier by providing flow monitoring that can alert the user to broken pipes and damaged sprinklers. It can also provide information on electrical currents to help detect broken or damaged wires and solenoids.</p><p>The opportunity and benefits are clear. Offering controller replacement services to your clients can be profitable in terms of installation revenue but also from a management and efficiency standpoint. So what do you need to know to get started?</p><h3>When to Recommend an Upgrade to the System</h3><p>Any system that doesn’t include the smart technology mentioned above is a good candidate for replacement. To gain Wi-Fi connectivity most controllers must be replaced entirely. Based on the water savings which may be achieved with proper installation and use most homeowners can recoup the cost of the controller in a relatively short period of time.</p><h3>How to Sell the Benefits</h3><p>For homeowners planning to manage their own systems the benefits are simple. A Wi-Fi-enabled controller allows them the manage their system from virtually anywhere and offers advanced automation features that allow them to save water and money with less effort. For homeowners with contractor-managed services it offers all the same savings while providing the opportunity for more accurate troubleshooting and fewer costly site visits from their landscape contractor.</p><h3>Technical Knowledge</h3><p>The good news is like all controllers Wi-Fi-enabled products come with detailed instructions for installation programming and management. Similar to other technological advances such as smart phones the systems are intuitive and relatively simple to install. But if you need help finding the right product or advice on comparing features SiteOne associates can always be of assistance.</p><p>Contact your local SiteOne representative to get more information about the business opportunities in irrigation controller replacement.

However, as a taxpayer, you have&nbsp;rights, including the right to&nbsp;consult a lawyer. This article is in no way intended to serve as legal advice,&nbsp;and you should consult an attorney if you are&nbsp;facing a tax audit.<br /><br />Look for an attorney&nbsp;who will provide customized solutions for difficult tax problems. When it comes&nbsp;to taxes, one size doesn&rsquo;t fit all, and you should find an attorney who will not only minimize the taxes you owe within the tax laws, but also reduce your stress by taking the weight of dealing with the IRS on a day-to-day basis off your shoulders.<br /><br />When you receive an&nbsp;audit notice from the IRS, your first reaction may be panic, but you need to&nbsp;assert yourself and let the IRS know that you are&nbsp;confident in your return. One&nbsp;of the quickest ways to regain your confidence is to set some ground rules for&nbsp;your audit. First, you have every right to&nbsp;establish the day and location of&nbsp;your audit. This will give you the necessary time to prepare. Second, you can educate&nbsp;yourself as to your liability and&nbsp;limit the audit to include just those issues&nbsp;relevant to the reason for the audit.<br /><br />Next, know your stuff.&nbsp;Were you aware that you can claim a deduction without a receipt or cancelled&nbsp;check? While we&rsquo;ve all been led to believe that you must have a receipt or canceled check to claim a deduction, few people realize that personal testimony may be enough to claim a deduction. If you have all the facts in order, reconstructed records, affadavits and other proof are valuable tools that can help you claim deductions when the original records are unavailable.<br /><br />Plus, in an audit the&nbsp;IRS may need you to authorize them to do certain thing&mdash;extend the time they&nbsp;have to collect a tax from you, for instance. Don&#39;t&nbsp;agree to anything unless&nbsp;your attorney agrees.<br /><br />Last, remember that an&nbsp;IRS auditor has no power to do anything without your permission; they cannot increase or decrease your tax liability, charge you with penalties or seize your assets. And, you have the Right of Appeal. Reminding your auditor that you know this may help you maintain control and pay only the taxes you owe.<br /><br />So, when you receive an&nbsp;audit notice from the IRS, remember, don&#39;t panic, contact an attorney, and know&nbsp;your rights. These three simple steps will&nbsp;help you maintain control and reduce&nbsp;the stress that comes with the notice.</p></div>";Surviving-A-Tax-Audit-ParagraphComponent

From hiring to terminating here are some proven methods for managing your employees.</p><h3>Expanding Your Business</h3><p>Many landscape companies rely on several day laborers to help with trenching installing pipe and heads and other routine tasks at residential jobs. But suppose these laborers are not irrigation experts. If you want to expand your business you have to add a project manager or site foreman who is up-to-date on installation techniques and new products and can also handle sales calls estimates and purchasing.</p><h3>The Pros and Cons</h3><p>The idea of having others to help you grow your business is often the first step to success. But you should first consider all of the pros and cons of having employees:</p><ul><li>Is there enough work to justify another person on the job full-time? Can you forecast the need for this person in the future?</li><li>Do you have the time necessary to recruit and train a new person?</li><li>Do you have the tools equipment and vehicles necessary to properly furnish the new employee?</li><li>Where should you look for new employees?</li><li>Have you considered all of the financial aspects including salary insurance taxes benefits etc.?</li><li>Can one of your existing employees handle more responsibilities?</li></ul><p>Promoting from within increases morale. The most important decision is whether this person will add significant income to your business. You might decide that an additional skilled employee will cut down on your workload. However when you figure in salary insurance equipment and the loss of time needed to train a new employee you may discover that it would not be a prudent business decision until you can count on a consistent pattern of steady jobs.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Five Rules of Recruiting</h3><p>Taking the time to locate good employees will often cut down on many of the problems you will encounter later. If you hire the right person now you can avoid unnecessary training warnings employee frustrations terminations and rehiring. Here are the five rules of recruiting a dependable competent long-term employee:</p><ol type=""1""><li>Locate an employee with professional skills and training. The Irrigation Association and local contractor associations often sponsor training programs. Some local colleges may have courses of study in irrigation irrigation system design horticulture turf grass management etc. and can recommend knowledgeable people.</li><li>Carefully review employment history. Long-term employees cut down on costs associated with training new paperwork and rehiring. Check all available references. Ask specifics about performance reliability and experience.</li><li>Note your first impression since it will probably be the same as your customer's. If it's good this will reflect well on your business.</li><li>Interview good candidates at least three times. You'll get a slightly different view each time. If all three are positive this candidate is probably a winner.</li><li>Find someone genuinely interested in your business. Past experience self-study and general knowledge will produce a more secure long-term employee.</li></ol></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Locating Qualified Workers</h3><p>Finding the right person also depends on where you look. While you can follow the general rule of classified advertising, there are better ways to find talented people:</p><ul><li>Make current employees aware of all job openings with detailed job qualifications, time frame and salary range.</li><li>Follow up recommendations from your peers in the industry.</li><li>Advertise through local landscape professional and community associations. These organizations often include individuals who can make good employees. You might also recruit through community colleges. Test out your needs and the employee's skills by first hiring them an as intern, and then later as a full-time employee.</li></ul></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Hiring Employees</h3><p>The best advice in hiring is to follow the rules and don't cut corners. Properly and completely fill out all necessary payroll paperwork and make the employee fully aware of the job requirements company guidelines reporting structure salary and benefits. Your accountant or attorney can give you tips on this. The more an employee knows at the start the more secure they will feel about all aspects of their job. For your protection have the employee sign a document indicating that they have received all of the necessary paperwork.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Tips on Immigrant Workers</h3><p>If you are hiring immigrant workers it is essential that you learn and follow the regulations for their employment. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) maintains a toll-free number (800-870-3676) where you can order copies of the M274 Handbook and forms.Even if you are careful to follow the guidelines you cannot always be certain that your employees are doing the same. The INS has been known to conduct all-out raids on established firms with agents and police officers taking workers into custody. Although the contracting firm may be in full compliance the documentation of their employees may be fraudulent.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Recognition and Training</h3><p>Now that you've located and hired the ideal employee it is important to keep them happy and in full support of your company. In addition to adequate pay bonuses and incentives there are several other ways you can show employees that you value them and their work.</p><ul><li>Recognition is an inexpensive yet highly effective method for improving morale and increasing production. Heartfelt thanks for a job well done certificates of achievement increased responsibilities employee contests and short notes on special occasions improve the self-worth of the employee.</li><li>Training is also good for morale while giving the employee a chance to spread their wings. If you can offer money or at least time off for professional seminars college reimbursements trade show attendance or even in-house seminars your employees will appreciate your commitment to them.

Except that it wouldn't.</p><p>Never mind the fact that customers are necessary to the green industry business model, without them there wouldn't be anyone to appreciate the hard-earned beauty of that new hardscape patio, water feature, lighting installation or backyard makeover.</p><p>Happy customers are more than necessary, you could argue that they mean everything to your business. So here are a few tips to keep your customers happy and create repeat and referral business.</p><h3>Set expectations from the start</h3><p>Your crew was hired because the client has something specific in mind. It's important to clearly understand what they want and clearly communicate how you can deliver. If there are any limitations to the project scope such as budget, materials, best practices, etc. now is the time to bring that up. Setting expectations from the start will reduce the potential for headaches and heartburn later on.</p><h3>Operate by the book</h3><p>Following best practices every time is not only good business, it's good customer service. Get signatures on all contracts and change orders, and ensure that all involved understand clearly what they're approving. This goes a long way toward communicating professionalism and integrity as a contractor.</p><h3>Manage personalities</h3><p>Whether it's a client or crewmember, try to anticipate personality conflicts before they arise. Pair your most detail-oriented crew with the pickiest clients, and identify specific customers who may need to call you directly instead of going through the front office. Balance these scales properly and the benefits will be significant.</p><p>While these tips might seem basic, when your crew is busiest is when the fundamentals can start to slip. Suddenly missteps on the easiest tasks can cause the biggest headaches. Too many missteps too often starts to become your reputation. So, it pays to stay vigilant on the basics of customer service.</p><p>To learn more about continuing education opportunities for green industry professionals through SiteOne visit the News and Events <link to News and Events> section of our website or speak with an expert at your local SiteOne branch <link to branch locator>.</p></div>";Customer-Service-ParagraphComponent

Simply try to present the inalienable truths that exist for the service(s) you provide. For instance with sprinkler irrigation we know that high pressure can wreak havoc on systems. We know that different soils soil textures slopes and climates dramatically influence our ability to deliver the right uniformity of water. We know that design spacing wind and climate all are extremely important factors for a golf course superintendent to consider if he or she is going to be successful in the turfgrass management of their course. Yet when you look at the products and techniques being used today in golf course applications and compare them to the basic truths that exist in irrigation you begin to understand that how we are approaching irrigation systems is the way that the world tells us we must instead of stopping and saying.Let's do what's right and truly in the best interest of the customer.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Often during the busy season, we hear from valued professional irrigation contractors .I can't handle another lead, or I can't get back to people, it's just too busy. In all, these are customer service situations. We need to start by believing that any action we take transpires because it's the right thing to do: calling a customer back fast, letting a customer know you appreciate their business, and developing solutions to a customer's problem. If we let the forces around us dictate how we act, react and handle situations, then we will always have a crutch to lean upon. However, if we start with basic principles of what we know is right, and then we pursue what is right with a specific end in mind, we will enjoy greater success, profitability and maintain the long-term value of our enterprises.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Pursuing what is right in your sales efforts and taking upon yourself a consultative selling role can help you increase your profits. Perhaps the biggest reason why is that you are approaching the situation from the customer's perspective trying to determine what the customer wants and the best possible way to deliver the right solution. If you believe that every job must first be approached from the price perspective then you're putting yourself in a position where the only way to win is by lowering your price to the detriment of your bottom line. You've stopped searching for customer solutions.</p><p>A very simple example is two professional irrigation contractors bidding on the same job. The first contractor makes a presentation based on making sure I'm priced competitive to get the job. By not even pursuing with the customer the ways things could be or should be the first contractor simply explains that he'll just have the rotors which water the turf spray onto the flowers and the customer will get the same job done at a lower cost. The second contractor takes a moment or two and tells the homeowner the way things could be done and how when those things are done right the customer will be able to have more control over the irrigation system healthier plants and turf and a better irrigation system. The second contractor in this real example got the job for a significantly higher price. Once the customer was shown and explained how things could be and that for a few dollars more they were able to get a system that did the job right the consultative sales process was complete.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>As sprinkler irrigation continues to reach a larger slice of the American population pie every year the pressures to provide more at lower cost gains momentum. It is in our interest the customer’s interest and the industry’s interest to put more emphasis on consultative selling. In the example of irrigation systems they are not only hard work to install but it takes knowledge and expertise to design and install them based on what is right.</p><p>Evaluate your sales process and the products and services you offer your customers. Are you providing and implementing what you know is right or are you forgetting to take into account if you are doing what is in the best interest of your customers?</p></div>";Consultative-Selling-ParagraphComponent

In addition to expanded hours when quieter battery-powered equipment may be operated it also carries greatly reduced maintenance requirements compared to gas-powered units.</p><p>There are a few things to keep in mind when selecting battery-powered tools for your professional landscaping crews:</p><ul>	<li>Consider running one system: Many companies offer systems where multiple handheld tools can operate on the same batteries. Purchasing tools from the same family creates efficiency in terms of parts extra batteries and ease of use.</li>	<li>Know what power numbers matter: Remember that a battery&#39;s ampere capacity is much more important than volts. Ampere hour (Ah) is the measure of battery duration. Ah is in essence your gas tank; the larger your tank the longer a battery will operate. Below are standard battery sizes and associated Ah values.<p>Wh (watt hours) is the technical unit of measure for battery capacity. It&#39;s important to remember that 1 Wh does not always equate to one hour. Length of run will be affected by the tool load and other conditions. For professional contractors this is an important number because you want the most work from a single charge.</p><p>As with many trends in the green industry the best advice will come at the local level. SiteOne experts at your local store can provide insight on current regulations and the best equipment selections for your area.</p>	<ul><li>82V 2.5AH = (20) 2.5AH Lithium Cells</li><li>82V 4AH = (40) 2AH Lithium Cells</li><li>82V 5AH = (40) 2.5AH Lithium Cells (Twice the capacity of the 2.5AH)<ul></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Choose the right tool categories: For many reasons electric string trimmers may not be the best investment but electric hedge trimmers leaf blowers pole saws and other ancillary tools can be just as effective as their gasoline counterparts. Make sure that the tools you choose to replace with electric equipment can deliver equivalent power to complete the job.</li></ul><p>For more information contact your local SiteOne representative or visit SiteOne.com to <a href=""/store-finder"" target=""_blank""><strong>find a branch near you</strong></a>.</p></div>";Tips-For-Selecting-Battery-Powered-Equipment-ParagraphComponent

Lawn care professionals face some sort of environmental change each and every year either it's too wet or too dry or warm too early or a late frost comes unexpectedly.</p><p>Slight modifications are needed in timing of applications or types of products used but in most cases the changes don't interrupt the final goal or business plan. However environmental changes can be so severe that drastic changes are required. For example drought conditions in some parts of the United States are forcing lawn care and landscape professionals to make drastic if not business-saving decisions. New ways of generating income need to be found if the companies want to keep key employees or even just stay alive. The more the conditions worsen the more creative business owners become. Sometimes businesses must diversify into markets and/or arenas that they never thought of before.</p><p>With this in mind the following suggestions are offered to help lawn care professionals generate income during drought conditions.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Soil Testing</h3><p>Soil testing provides the turfgrass manager with a way to provide service to clients throughout the entire year. Results can be used later during product application assisting the operator in balancing the proper amounts of nitrogen phosphorous and potassium as well as lime and sulfur. We recommend that soil tests be done annually so that changes can be monitored over a number of years.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Application of Lime or Sulfur</h3><p>Based soil test results applications of lime may be needed to correct pH levels. Applications of pelletized dolomitic limestone during periods of drought will not cause injury to the turf. Please advise your customers that limestone particles may be carried to low lying areas if a large amount of rainfall occurs over a short period of time. CAUTION: Sulfur should NOT be applied during periods of drought or while the turfgrass is under stress conditions. Rates will be given on the soil test results form.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Spraying Dye in Mulch Beds</h3><p>Applications of Mulch Magic will freshen up faded mulch beds without adding additional mulch. This method involves less labor than adding additional mulch and can be done by one employee.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Spot Treatment of Weeds in Parking Lots and Driveways</h3><p>Using a nonselective herbicide such as glyphosate on unwanted weeds growing in cracks of parking lots and driveways can be a good source of additional income. This can be done at anytime during growing season and weeds can be found on most every property. Be careful not to use a product that might run-off and cause plant injury once irrigation is applied.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Coloring of Dormant Turf</h3><p>Coloring dormant turf is a quick and easy way to make brown grass green.

;;Managing-Turf-Drought-ParagraphComponent;"<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p>Most turfgrasses are resilient and will recover from drought conditions with minimal injury if proper management practices are implemented prior to and after the onset of stress. Turf needs proper amounts of moisture and nutrients to aid in the recovery process. Proper cultural practices will also aid in drought tolerance and recovery.</p><p>Cool season grasses perform best in temperatures between 60 degrees and 75 degrees Fahrenheit whereas warm season turf performs well at temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Low soil moisture and increased temperatures between the months of June and August are very stressful to cool season turf. Due to low soil moisture the first signs of dormancy will be a loss of color in the turf. The turf will take on a bluish-gray color and become very dry and brittle. Applying as little as one inch of water per week can help the turf to retain color. Turfgrass can usually survive 4-5 weeks of dormancy with minimal damage. Dormant grass will not recover if the rhizomes roots and crowns dehydrate.</p><p>Proper irrigation practices are critical during times of drought. It is important to water deeply and infrequently opposed to lightly and frequently. Watering deeply helps the water to penetrate the soil allowing more moisture availability and retention. Watering lightly and frequently keeps the moisture on the surface causing quicker evaporation and shallow root development. Water should be applied in the early morning hours (between 5am - 9am). Avoid irrigation in the afternoon due to rapid evaporation and heat build up. Also avoid irrigation in the evening due to the promotion of disease pressure. In times of water bans one half inch of water every one to two weeks may be enough to keep the crown rhizomes and roots hydrated.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Mowing</h3><p>Certain precautions should be made when mowing turf during drought conditions. Always be sure that mower blades are sharp to avoid tearing the turf. Turf mowed with dull mower blades will take on a brownish-gray cast soon after mowing because of moisture loss through the torn tip of the grass blades. Do not remove more than one third of the new growth in any one mowing. Removing too much top growth will cause a reduction in root mass and will not enable the plant to retain enough moisture. Alternate mowing patterns to avoid soil compaction caused by tire tracking. These practices will help control stress during drought conditions, but should be practiced the entire season.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Fertilization</h3><p>Proper fertilization will help the turf become more stress-resistant and allow the plant to recover more quickly from the stress. Providing the turf with adequate potassium prior to drought conditions will help make the plant more stress-, insect- and disease-resistant and enable quicker recovery in the fall. Using slow release nitrogen will help keep the plant growing during drought periods and help the turf maintain its color. Avoid quick release nitrogen before and during drought periods. This practice can flush top growth and can predispose the plant to injury much quicker due to an out of balance root to shoot ratio (root growth to top growth ratio). It is best to use a 1:1 ratio of nitrogen to potassium to improve stress tolerance within the plant.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Wetting Agents</h3><p>Hydrophobic (water repellent) soils are found in many areas where turfgrass is grown. The use of long-term residual wetting agents will help alleviate problems associated with localized dry spot from hydrophobic soils for up to an entire growing season. Long-term residual wetting agents, like LESCOFlo Ultra, work best when applied preventively prior to moisture stress. Shorter residual wetting agents, such as LESCOWet Plus, also help alleviate problem areas from localized dry spot, but may need to be applied on a more frequent schedule. It is critically important that both long- and short-term residual wetting agents be incorporated into the soil with irrigation for the products to become effective in the alleviation of localized dry spot conditions. Keep in mind that wetting agents do not assist in water retention.

There are many factors involved when attempting to control crabgrass with pre-emergent herbicides. These include herbicide selection, application rates, soils, cultural practices, environmental factors, and most importantly, timing. In many cases, improper application timing is the leading cause of crabgrass breakthrough. Applied too late, crabgrass will germinate and begin growth before the herbicide is incorporated into the soil. Applications made too early will have a depleted residual before all weed seeds have germinated.</p><p>When it comes to application timing, there are a few theories that are typically followed. These theories have some relevancy, but with changing weather patterns a more precise determination may be necessary.</p><p>Pre-emergent timing is often based on ornamental plant activity, including forsythia and lilac. It is often recommended to apply pre-emergent herbicides when these plants begin to bloom. This theory can somewhat be accurate, but does the germination of crabgrass really correlate with these plants? Maybe not. A good example of this would be a short period of above normal temperatures. These temperatures may cause ornamental plants to bloom, but the soil temperatures may remain the same or increase only a little. Also, the ornamental plants could have certain stresses on them, which may delay the blooming period.</p><p>Another theory based on the thickness of the lawn may be used. This theory suggests a thin lawn should have herbicides applied a little early and thicker lawns should have herbicides a little later in regard to forsythia blooming. As we have all seen, crabgrass germinates and thrives just as well in thick, healthy turf as it does in weak, thin turf.</p><p>For these reasons, the most beneficial time to apply pre-emergent herbicides can be determined by monitoring soil temperatures. This is the method most universities rely on. By monitoring the soil temperature, turf mangers can accurately plan for crabgrass germination. By most indications, crabgrass will germinate when the soil temperatures reach 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit for at least three days.</p></div>";Timing-Crabgrass-Treatment-ParagraphComponent

The ability of the soil to provide nutrition to a plant is critical to the overall health of a plant. When a soil is unable to provide nutrients in the proper amounts it can lead to reduced plant vigor and increased susceptibility to damage from disease insects drought and other conditions.</p><p>Routine soil testing is a great tool to help point out nutrient deficiencies and surpluses soil pH and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). Understanding the test results allows for the selection of the appropriate fertilizer or amendments to help correct deficiencies and other problems to optimize the uptake of fertilizer nutrients by the plant. Optimum nutrient uptake is critical as lost fertilizer nutrients due to lack of uptake equates to lost dollars.</p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Soil pH</h3><p>Optimum soil pH is species dependent but generally speaking turfgrass shrub and flower nutrient uptake is maximized when soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.0. Most soil nutrients are readily available when the soil pH is 6.5. If pH drops below 6.0 and soils are more acidic elements like manganese and aluminum become more soluble and their excessive uptake can reach toxic levels causing plant stress and failure.</p><p>Conversely high pH or highly alkaline soils usually suffer from reduced nutrient and especially micronutrient lock-up (iron magnesium and calcium). They can have high concentrations of sodium resulting in poor soil structure. Water and essential nutrients don't easily penetrate poorly structured soils resulting in nutrient deficiencies and stunted plant growth. </p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Changing Soil pH</h3><p>Soil pH is typically lowered with sulfur and raised with lime. Pelletized lime is generally the preferred method of lime application over granular for raising pH as it is much easier to apply pellets break down with water are less dusty and pelletized lime changes the pH quicker than granular lime. Dolomitic or calcitic lime may be used depending on the soils need for magnesium or calcium.</p><p>In many Western states and certain pockets of the U.S. soil pH may be greater than 7.5 and may need to be lowered using sulfur. The amount of sulfur to be used should be based on the soil test as soil type as well as soils that contain high amounts of free calcium carbonate aka ""free lime"" will require greater amounts of sulfur to lower pH. </p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Proper Sampling</h3><p>Soil test results are only as good as the samples collected and sent to the lab for analysis. Improper sampling is the largest area for error in the soil testing process and can lead to test results that could recommend over- or under application of nutrients and amendments.</p><p>Make sure to collect a representative sample of each area being tested. 1-2 cups of soil are needed for proper testing and should be free of plant tissue thatch mulch or other surface debris. For areas up to 10 000 sq. ft. 10-12 individual cores should be randomly taken and combined to make one composite sample to be placed in a sample bag. For areas over 10 000 sq. ft. randomly take one extra core for each additional 1 000 sq. ft.</p><p>Separate samples should be collected from areas that differ in soil color soil texture and type of plants grown. Avoid areas that have recently been fertilized or amended. Turf should be sampled at a depth of 3"" below the thatch layer while trees shrubs and ornamentals should be sampled to a depth of 6-12"" with cores being taken from inside and just outside the drip line. </p></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><h3>Benefits of Soil Testing</h3><p>Soil testing is an agronomic Best Management Practice (BMP) recommended by the fertilizer industry university agronomists and independent consultants that provides many benefits to the turf/landscape manager including:</p><ul><li>Monitors pH and nutrient levels in turf and landscape soils</li><li>Offers corrective action to optimize nutrient uptake (reduce lost fertilizer from nutrient lock-up)</li><li>Aids in customization of fertility programs</li><li>Promotes good industry stewardship</li><li>Allows you to grow a healthy and flourishing landscape to put your stamp on</li></ul></div>";Benefits-Of-Soil-Testing-ParagraphComponent

Spring flowering bulbs must be planted in the fall to develop a good root system and to satisfy the bulb&rsquo;s cold requirement for blooming. In general, it&rsquo;s best to plant when the soil temperature is below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, but before the first frost. Use the following tips from our nursery experts to ensure your bulbs have the best chance at an impressive spring.<br /&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>BULB SELECTION: </strong></p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Bulbs should be firm, not mushy or soft, that signals a dead or bad bulb. Occasionally mold may form on the outer skin but can easily be brushed off and causes no harm to the bulb.</p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Tulips, unlike other fall planting bulbs, are not native to American gardens, and will not return the following year. Customers who deal with deer and rabbits can use deer resistant varieties like scilla, daffodils, and allium to help curb destruction in their garden.&nbsp;</p><ul></ul></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>HOW TO PLANT BULBS: </strong></p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Good soil preparation is the key to planting bulbs. Generally, larger bulbs are planted about 8&rdquo; deep, and 5&rdquo; deep for the smaller varieties.&nbsp; The rule of thumb is that the depth of the bulb should be 3X the diameter. Bulbs prefer good draining soil, and do not like wet feet, so areas that collect heavy water are not ideal.</p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Place large bulbs with the nose facing upwards in the planting hole. Small bulbs can be scattered. The distance between the bulbs depends on the visual effect you are looking for.&nbsp; If using containers, bulbs may be planted in layers based on size. Always place the bulb with the pointed side up, cover with soil, water, and let the winter rains and snow take care of watering until spring. Plant bulbs in clumps, or stagger to create larger washes of color. Paying attention to bloom times when planting can help fill in spent blooms in the garden and create a show of color that lasts all spring.</p><ul><li><strong>Planters and Pots: </strong>Plant bulbs in layers to prolong the flowering period. Bulbs that flower early can be planted on top of the later flowering bulbs.<br />&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Lawns and Grass Strips: </strong>Daffodils, Crocus, and Scilla Siberica are very suitable for planting under grass. The earliest flowering bulb types are the best choice.<br />&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mass Plantings in Beds and Borders: </strong>Add spring flowering bulbs to perennial and rose borders for a burst of color in early spring.<br />&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Naturalizing Bulbs: </strong>Daffodils, Crocus, Muscari, Scilla, and most other small bulbs are perennial and can be left in the soil to return for many years.</li></ul></div><div class=""cl""></div><div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>KNOW YOUR HARDINESS ZONE: </strong></p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Proper knowledge of the zone where bulbs are to be planted will help minimize failures when spring arrives. Familiarize your customers with the zones their properties occupy and read bulb labels to help ensure you&rsquo;re planting at the right time.</p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Within colder regions (zones 1 through 4 or a mountainous region) use additional mulch to protect against severe freezing temperatures (20 degrees below zero).&nbsp; Remember, however, heavy mulching will need to be removed in spring to ensure the flower can bloom properly.</p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><br /><strong>BULB STORAGE: </strong></p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Bulbs need to be kept in a cool and dry location with good circulation and low humidity prior to planting. The warmer temperatures and healthy rains in spring activate bulbs, so storing in areas that have higher moisture and heat will trigger a bulb to grow. Bulbs with sprouts can still be planted, but the sprout should not be removed, or the plant will not grow.</p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><br /><strong>AFTER-CARE: </strong></p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">After a bulb has bloomed and faded, do not cut down the leaves and stalk. Let the plant die back naturally and brown out over the course of late spring and early summer.&nbsp; Once brown, remove the spent leaves. Some bulbs, after time, will need to be dug up and divided, to ensure continued flowering.</p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Bulbs are an excellent choice for public gardens, parks, golf courses, municipalities, and any landscape design.

Selecting year round interest plants emphasizes the beauty of your landscape design as well as reinforcing the value of your services to customers when surrounding yards are dormant. </p><p>The main characteristics of good transitional plantings are those that are <strong>early indicators</strong> (blooming early in the spring) those with <strong>interesting defoliation patterns</strong> or peeling bark and those that maintain a <strong>verdant appearance year round</strong>.  Below are our top picks for early spring species that exemplify these traits: </p><p><strong>Forsythia</strong>- Marked by golden yellow blooms Forsythia is one of the earliest seasonal indicators.  In fact some landscape contractors even use the blooming of forsythia as a reminder to begin applying pre-emergent herbicide to their customers’ turf and ornamental beds.  Another benefit to specifying this plant is its affordability. </p><p><strong>Crocus</strong>- This plant starts as a bulb that’s planted in the fall before the first frost of the year.  It requires long periods of coolness and dark to activate so it performs best in areas that have a distinct shift from winter to spring weather patterns.  It blooms low to the ground and displays best in clusters. </p><p><strong>Daffodils</strong>- Another flower that starts as a bulb daffodils are another early indicator like forsythia.  Remember to plant these bulbs with the pointed ends up.  Popular early-blooming color varieties include Dutch Master and February Gold. </p><p><strong>Boxwood- </strong>This long-time favorite shrub remains a nice looking plant throughout the year in a majority of the country.  The Solid Evergreen variety tends to do well in most hardiness zones and provides some good texture and a leafy backdrop for the early blooming flowers included in this list.</p><p><strong>Flowering cherries</strong>- Flowering cherry trees come in a variety of colors and contrast nicely in texture with the dormant leaves of other plants early in the season.  This tree usually does well in the southeast up through the northern region of the US.  </p><p>It’s important to remember that your specific jobsite location will play a major role in what spring planting(s) will perform best.  This list is designed as a basic guide; however factors like sun exposure USDA zones the need for pest resistant plants or specific watering requirements will also impact the recommended plant types.  </p><p><a href=""/en/nurserydirect"">SiteOne’s Nursery Direct Program</a> offers direct nationwide shipment of quality plant products directly to your jobsite even if you don’t have a nursery near you.

At the same time, growers who supplied the liner stock of young trees also cut back on production, causing a ripple effect that is impacting production cycles.</p><p>This is especially true for plants such as large caliper trees, which have a much longer growth cycle. Demand is so high for two-inch caliper Live Oak and Red Maple trees that growers are selling trees that were supposed to be held for development into three and four-inch caliper sizes. This places even more strain on the future supply of large caliper trees.</p><p>The supply of these trees is so tight that contractors who want large orders of Live Oaks&nbsp;(a staple for large commercial projects or residential developments)&nbsp;are likely to encounter challenges securing their full order. And contractors who typically buy plants from the yard the day of a project may not find the trees they want in-stock.</p><p>Luckily, with some planning and strategy, contractors can still get the plants they need.</p><p>Re-wholesalers, such as SiteOne, can leverage their unique market position to increase the likelihood that an order can be filled, but it takes some planning on the part of the contractor. To increase their chances of success, contractors should:</p><ul><li><strong>Order Early.</strong> If contractors can project demand for the upcoming planting season, SiteOne associates can start working to increase the likelihood of filling a full order for short-supply plants.</li><li><strong>Know What to Ask For.</strong> Plants that have a relatively short growing cycle, such as container shrubs, will be in abundant supply when the time comes. However, for larger trees, contractors should communicate their needs as soon as possible to their suppliers.</li>	<li><strong>Tell Your Friends (And Enemies).</strong> Distributors make projections based on internal sales numbers, but that&#39;s sales data, not demand data. To help ensure accurate projections, suppliers need to hear from multiple contractors in every region. If suppliers have more demand data about a region, they can better balance their projections and recommendations to growers. When suppliers can make projections based on demand, it means contractors are less likely to be caught in the supply squeeze.</li></ul><p>When it comes down to the bottom line, the benefits of working with a large re-wholesaler are clear:</p><ul><li><strong>National Reach + Regional Expertise:</strong> SiteOne purchases plants from more than 1,000 growers nationwide, but the actual plant buying happens on a regional level. With full-time field buyers working across five regions, SiteOne has deep local knowledge on demand, quality and availability.</li><li><strong>Smart Forecasting:</strong> Because SiteOne possesses unique, detailed nation-wide knowledge on market conditions, our teams can make far more accurate projections for plant needs. This allows SiteOne to confidently enter into growing agreements with growers to secure the right products. Some current grower contracts extend into 2021.</li><li><strong>Product Shifting:</strong> On occasion, unexpected weather conditions can quickly alter regional demand for certain plants. SiteOne&#39;s national network allows us to quickly move product to the areas of the most demand or need, providing a more relevant selection to our customers.</li></ul><p>As growers and suppliers work to meet the high demand for some plants, SiteOne is uniquely positioned to deliver the benefits of national reach to local markets. Given advance notice from contractors, SiteOne can increase the likelihood that challenging orders can be filled.</p><p>For more information on plant availability or anticipated shortages in your area, contact your local SiteOne store where experts can help you plan for upcoming projects. <a href=""/en/store-finder""><strong>Find your nearest branch</strong></a> location.</p></div>";Planning-Plant-Purchases-ParagraphComponent

With a little guidance and know-how, the process is relatively easy to add as a profitable service offering. Contractors report that the margins from outdoor lighting are better than almost all segments of existing services. SiteOne is illuminating the path with three steps: target customers, close the sale and feel confident in adding landscape lighting to your portfolio.<br /><br /><br /><strong>What is the ROI for You?</strong><br />Landscape lighting is a bright idea for you and your customer, especially as more and more homeowners look to expand outdoor living areas. It’s an affordable way to beautify your client’s home and create additional living space without costly renovations. Installing deck lights, hanging lights or path lights can create a memorable ambiance around eating and grilling areas, patios, pools and spas. Special effects created with up lights or in-ground well lights can enhance curb appeal and highlight hardscapes, architectural details and/or the great landscaping work that your team tackles for the customer. And when strategically positioned, outdoor light fixtures can make your clients’ home safer by lighting walkways, steps and entryways.<br /><br />When your business knows how to install lighting, it’s an added bonus for your customers. Since you are currently working for them, it means they don’t need to shop around for additional trusted professionals — you can service their lighting needs. Lighting can be sold as an additional component of new irrigation, maintenance or hardscape projects. It can be added as a profitable service to fill in the down months outside of the standard irrigation, maintenance or hardscape installation seasons and keep your crews busy. Finally, don’t limit “lighting” to the warm seasons. Every year, more homeowners are electing to hire a contractor to adorn their home in holiday lights. This is a growing segment that offers additional space to build profitably during the slower months. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Is Lighting Right for Your Customer?</strong><br />Yes. However, getting customers to understand and know it’s right for them takes a bit of legwork. Apply these three steps to help grow your customer base:<br /> <br />1.    Go back to the basics and find any opportunity to start; this could be your home or a friend or relative’s house. The key to successfully selling outdoor lighting — take lots of pictures. Before and after pictures of any project can spark the emotion while satisfying the reason in a customer’s brain. Consider giving early clients, even friends or family, a discount to allow the house to be used in your marketing efforts (Friendly reminder: don’t forget to ask for permission!). <br /><br />2.    Review previous accounts you have completed work for. A good customer from a past project will be willing to work with you on this new endeavor.  <br /><br />3.    Once a target customer has been identified, ask lots of questions. What do they want to do with their lighting project? What is the budget? If no budget is available, put together two versions (simple and full coverage) of a proposal — it’s likely you will land somewhere in the middle. Other questions to ask include: Where is the power source? What is the function of the space you want to illuminate? Do you anticipate expanding the space or adding additional lighting in the next two to three years? Do you live in a community that has lighting restrictions such as dark sky or sea turtle protection?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Is There an Easy Way to Sell Lighting? </strong><br />Most of the time when you buy a product, you know what you’re getting. But with outdoor lighting, homeowners often don’t fully understand the true value of a well-designed and properly installed outdoor lighting system. The solution is summed up in three words — Lighting Demo Kits (call your SiteOne branch to obtain a kit). <br /><br />Contractors report that when demo kits were requested by the homeowner, they experienced a closing rate over 80 percent. And when the contractor presented the lighting kit (without the homeowner asking for it), they still realized a higher closing rate of more than 35 percent. Talk about a win-win! There are five tips that will aid in completing the sale of the job:<br /> <ol><li>Always schedule your installation during the day. Then, return in the evening to showcase the setup to your clients. With this approach, you can present the system after dark, when the lighting effects will be most dramatic.<br /> </li><li>Choose a specific area to illuminate. You want to ensure that you’re highlighting a few focal points, instead of partially lighting a larger area. A great way to do this is by having a simple conversation with the homeowners.<br /> </li><li>After dusk, give the lighting system a test run. Adjust the lights as needed before the big reveal. When everything is perfect, turn off the lights. Then, bring the homeowners outside. Finally, with everyone standing in the dark, turn on all the lights at once. <br /> </li><li>If you’re using a demo kit with control capabilities, take time to engage the homeowners on the zoning, dimming and color capabilities of the system. Be sure to install the app on their phone(s) and pre-set any themes in advance. Put the control at their fingertips so they can freely toggle between themes and change lighting effects.<br /> </li><li>Leave the lights up for several days or, ideally, over a weekend. You want the homeowners to enjoy the lighting and get used to having it. You also want to provide enough time for their neighbors to see it or, better yet, for the homeowners to invite their neighbors over.</li></ol><br />Using lighting demo kits are the fastest and easiest way to show homeowners exactly what lighting will bring to their outdoor living spaces. And if you’re new to lighting, it’s the best way to practice lighting techniques.<br /><br />You have the tools to get the job done, but you need the know-how. SiteOne has the resources and people on standby to navigate the process as a lighting contractor, including: <ul><li>Lighting courses through <a href=""/events"">SiteOne University</a>.</li><li>Skilled lighting experts ready to answer any questions at your SiteOne Landscape Supply branch. </li><li>Design support from manufacturers or a member of our team. </li><li>Technical support from the manufacturer. </li><li>Extensive product inventory and availability on <a href=""/lighting"">SiteOne.com/lighting</a>. </li></ul><br />SiteOne has done the legwork so you can equip your team to conquer new challenges and drive your business to the next frontier of outdoor lighting. </div>";cmsitem_00030006

If 2020 has proven anything, it’s that the unexpected is always possible. <br /><br />As a landscape business owner, the last thing you want is for your business to be vulnerable to occupational and environmental uncertainty. Contrary to what you might think, a plan is a great way to mitigate the risks associated with unpredictability.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Effective Budgeting = Profitable Landscape Business Planning </strong><br /><br />A well-executed plan starts and stops with the budget. An in-depth budget breakdown does more than just help track your transactions. It could mean the difference between profitability and bankruptcy. <br /><br />Budgeting helps businesses: <ul><li>Create realistic estimates for costs and overhead </li><li>Better manage your cash flows</li><li>Identify profitability weaknesses</li></ul><br />Financially-supported plans can also help landscape businesses develop a competitive advantage. Don’t believe us? More than 87% of contractors have never built a functioning budget for their company. Staying true to numbers could help you gain clients and edge out the competition.<br /> <br /><br /><strong>Scale with Your Crew </strong><br /><br />Crews are the backbone of any lawn and landscape business. The key to any successful organization is to develop, attract, and <a href=""https://golmn.com/2020/03/16/hiring-series-how-to-find-and-recruit-top-talent-for-your-landscaping-business/"" target=""_blank"">retain talented employees</a>. A great way to do that is by rewarding your contractors for their hard work. Performance-based incentives are an excellent way to encourage high-quality efforts that help grow your business. <br /><br />Establishing a scalable wage structure is integral to any landscape business owner with high aspirations. LMN Time helps users track their crew’s hours while also providing work incentives. This cloud-based technology is a cost-effective way to keep your company scalable<br /> <br /><br /><strong>Learn to Say ‘No’</strong><br /><br />Not all work is good work. If you don’t have the capacity to take on additional assignments or clients, then you shouldn’t accept the job. Too much work can wear out your crew and compromise the quality of the product you deliver. <br /><br />Saying no isn’t just applicable to external work. It can also be extremely valuable to developing work culture. Employees and contractors should be encouraged to ask for help or delegate work when they hit their limit. This will maximize the abilities of your staff and protect your finances in the long-run. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Implement Process from The Ground-Up</strong><br /><br />Of all 2021 landscaping business tips, this may be the most important. As sought after as growth is, it comes with its own complications. The greatest obstacle associated with growth is operational disconnect. <br /><br />By establishing productive work processes and <a href=""https://golmn.com/2017/03/15/improve-your-companys-internal-external-communication/"" target=""_blank"">communication</a> channels early, your business can grow with these systems. Establishing good habits from the beginning is always more profitable than correcting long-lasting, bad habits. <br /><br />In a way, effective landscape business planning is a lot like hitting a golf ball. Your plan of attack is only as effective as your follow-through. Nailing the perfect swing, however, is very difficult and requires years of experience. <br /><br />To successfully integrate planning into your landscape business, you need more than just a list of 2021 landscape business tips. You need a system and structure.<br /><br />LMN’s suite of cloud-based landscape management applications and education resources can provide these systems and structure.

The question now is what can be saved and how. Our plant freeze recovery tips will help.<br /><br /><strong>Determine a Plant’s Condition</strong><br /><br />Shrub and tree damage can be effectively checked a few ways. <br /><br />•    Smaller branches should still be pliable, bendable, or springy. If they snap while testing their elasticity, (slightly bending the smaller parts of the branch) it’s a sign of damage. <br /><br />•    Leaves that are damaged will drop from the branches naturally if the actual branches remain intact. A branch that holds dead leaves, or doesn’t drop them, is no good.<br /><br />•    Use the “simple scratch” test. Start scratching at the tip of the branch and continue to move back and forth making small scratches every foot until you find green. The deeper you go to find green the deeper the damage. If green appears early in the process the tree or shrub should survive. <br /><br /><strong>Patiently Wait to See How Much Damage There Really Is </strong><br /><br />Patience is a virtue. If you can hold up on pruning, you’ll be better off. <br /><br />•    As plants leaf back out over the next few weeks or a month, you will see how extensive the damage may be.<br />​​​​​​​<br />•     If the tips of a plant have not come back or “re-leafed,” you will be able to determine just how far you need to prune.  <br /><br /><strong>Check Sensitive Plants</strong><br /><br />Plants like <a href=""/search/?searchtype=product&amp;text=Loropetalum"">Loropetalum</a>, <a href=""/search/?searchtype=product&amp;text=Rosemary"">Rosemary</a>, <a href=""/search/?searchtype=product&amp;text=hawthorn"">Hawthorns</a>, Wax Leaf Ligustrum and other similar varieties, will probably need to be replaced after a deep freeze. If they were protected from colder winds, or were closer to a house, they still may survive. Give them a few weeks to see how they rebound. If in 14 to 28 days nothing has happened, then it’s likely time for replacing. <br /><br /><strong>Get the Mush out of there!</strong><br /><br />Is vegetation mushy and rotting? That’s disease waiting to infect your landscape. <br />​​​​​​​<ul><li>If foliage is mushy, remove the material as soon as possible. Be sure to only remove the wet and mushy parts. <br /> </li><li>Do not remove the whole plant unless it is all mushy. Agave and Aloes could come back from the roots. However, depending on the plant size, this can be a slow process and it might be easier to replace than nurse the plant back.<br /> </li><li>In the case of Agave and Aloes, as well as some cactus, it can take a year plus for them to rebound.<br /> </li><li>For palms, brown fronds should be removed to help stimulate possible new fronds sprouting from the center of the trunk. It could be eight or more weeks before new fronds emerge.  However, waiting is the only way to determine if a plant will rebound. </li></ul><br /><strong>Know When to Wait</strong> <br /><br />Remember those nice perennials that you planted the past few years? They may or may not be coming back after this freeze. A lot of the popular perennials were not made to handle the weather that Texas experienced during the freeze. Your best practice is to patiently wait to see how much damage did, or did not, occur.<br /><br /><strong>Replace Lost Plants</strong><br /><br />Follow these helpful tips and start replacing lost plants now<br />​​​​​​​<ul><li>If you are looking at annuals and softer material, you are good by mid-March to early April (Watch the long range forecast though.)<br /> </li><li>Start with plants that don’t mind cool lows at night. <br />​​​​​​​</li><li>Be sure you’re sourcing planting material that is hardy for your specific growing areas.</li></ul><br /><strong>Fertilizing Recovering Plants</strong><br /><br />At the start, access your stressed plant material and make sure everything is hydrated. You will want to water them, not drown them. A moderate amount of water can go a long way.  Then, if your plant is alive and taking water, help it along with some food. There are several things that you want to be sure of before you do any fertilizing of your recovering plants.<br />​​​​​​​<ol><li>Be sure that you are past the possibility of another cold snap before you begin to feed your plants. Fertilizer will stimulate your plants to start to grow, but another frost during this stimulation can be damaging.  <br /> </li><li>Stay away from fertilizer that has a very high first number in the formula followed by two very low numbers after, such as 28-3-10 or 24-0-0. These fertilizers are designed to push top growth and can do more damage to an already weak plant. <br />​​​​​​​</li><li>Use fertilizers that offer a mild blend/balanced formula like <a href=""/510075-lesco-fertilizer-lo-14-14-14-40-lb/p/339122"">LESCO Granular L&O 14-14-14</a>. There is a lower chance of burning and the balanced formula will address your plants’ overall needs. You’ll also want to stick with a granular formula over a liquid feed to promote extended release that’s longer lasting and will deliver nutrients in a more balanced way.</li></ol><br />Nothing can completely undo the damage plants and shrubs faced in the freeze. But our nursery branches are poised to help you with questions and replacements.  Visit SiteOne.com to start sourcing new plant material or visit your local branch for in-person assistance. <br /> </div></div>";cmsitem_00028012

Here are some important questions to consider if you’re thinking of installing or upgrading your customers’ to LED fixtures and lamps. <br /><br /><br /><strong>How can I diagnose and fix an LED fixture short?</strong><br />Shorts occur when electricity arcs within the system. The direct burial wire used to power lighting has 2 wires, and arcs happen when the currents passing through these wires touch each other. There are a multitude of reasons for this, but a few common ones are a poor wire connection, use of the wrong outdoor connection system, a cut or frayed wire, moisture damage within the system, and places where wire is stretched over roots and rocks. You’ll also want to look for broken filaments and yellow colored LED diodes, which indicate lamp burnout. <br /><br />If all your lights are out, this is probably an easy fix. Check and reset the breaker in your customer’s transformer. If this does not fix the issue and there’s no power to the transformer, check the GFCI outlet on the circuit. Reset this, then try resetting the breaker again. If the outlets are working, check the voltage and amperage- the transformer could need to be replaced. Ensure wires entering the transformer are inside the terminal lugs and tightened, as these wires could potentially arc off each other. If customers have a photocell within their transformer that is another thing to check; bypass this and try again. If the lights are working, you’ll need to replace the photocell. You can also use your voltmeter on individual fixtures to check power to specific fixtures, which is a good way to track a short. <br /><br />If some lights work and others don’t within a well-built system, this is typically due to lamp burnout and you can simply replace the <a href=""/lighting-lamps/c/sh1114"" target=""_blank"">LED lamps</a>. However, if that does not work, check the connections next. Connections that slide can loosen, pull at the wire, and allow moisture in, causing damage. If this is the problem, consider switching the system to copper crimps or heat shrink connections, as these work more efficiently. After checking the lamps and connections, ensure the sockets are high grade and the seals are intact. If the seals are broken, the sockets could have moisture damage and you should replace them. <br /><br />If a section of lights is out in a certain area, it indicates that a run has been cut off a circuit. If you’ve tried all of the above and the lights continue to trip, it could mean a cut wire is the issue and will need to be replaced.  <br /><br /><img src=""/medias/sys_master/root/hc9/h65/9104950132766/article-infographic-lighting.png"" style=""width:100%"" /><br /><br /><strong>How many lights can I put on one line of wire?</strong><br />The number of lights on a circuit depends entirely on the load of the fixtures. An analysis should be completed to calculate the voltage drop. Voltage drop should stay within the manufacturer’s design limits. The more fixtures you add to a run, the more the voltage is reduced. The National Electrical Code states that a circuit cannot supply more than 80% of the circuit breaker’s limits. Ensure the voltage is consistent throughout the line and distributed evenly, avoiding “daisy chaining,” or connecting light fixtures from one to the next on a single circuit, as this makes it difficult to get enough power to the lights at the end of the line. <br /><br />Wire runs should be split down the middle and fed through the center to avoid voltage drops. Another way to avoid these drops is to use a <a href=""/vp2-150x2-vista-300w-stainless-steel-vpro2-dual-circuit-transformer/p/480078"" target=""_blank"">multi-tap transformer</a> with multiple output voltages, ranging from 12-15V, to accommodate larger wire runs. Check your manufacturer’s design specifications to ensure that wiring and transformer size align with your project&#39;s needs.<br /><br />Using LED lamps can help as their drivers allow a range of voltage loads. However, you’ll still want to match the suggested voltage as best as possible to not shorten their lifespan.  <br /><br />Use a <a href=""/dm-45-greenlee-digital-multimeter/p/301146"" target=""_blank"">voltage meter</a> to check each light fixture in the run before completing your work to ensure each fixture receives the correct voltage. Check your lamps and fixtures for wattage and voltage information and ensure you have the right tools for the job or visit your local <a href=""/store-finder"" target=""_blank"">SiteOne branch</a> today.<br /> </div>";cmsitem_00033038

This has disrupted natural water infiltration systems and increased runoff tremendously. As drainage problems become more common, municipalities, customers, and contractors are looking for better stormwater management solutions. </p><p>Permeable pavers allow precipitation to percolate through joints; it is slowed and filtered by different layers of aggregate before returning to the soil. According to Unilock, permeable pavers can handle over 100” of stormwater per hour. This improves water quality, helps groundwater recharge, and reduces both runoff and the heat island effect. The Environmental Protection Agency recognizes permeable pavers as a best stormwater management practice.</p><p>There are many kinds of permeable pavers to choose from depending on client needs. There are plastic-grid pavers with flexible joints, rolled plastic pavers, <a href=""https://unilock.com/product/dura-mat-boston/"" target=""_blank"">interlocking concrete grids</a>, and permeable concrete and asphalt pavement. These vary in price and functionality.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Benefits to Customers </strong><br /><br />Permeable pavers are as attractive as traditional hardscapes, but mimic how natural ground reacts to rain and therefore don’t require the separate drainage system that other hardscapes do. The slow filtering of stormwater reduces the burden on storm drains. When rain hits a surface like traditional concrete or asphalt, it picks up pollutants like oil and gas. The aggregate laid below permeable pavers is conducive to bacteria growth, which help break down the pollutants before the water returns to the ground, keeping water supplies cleaner. Additionally, permeable pavers can help with erosion control on customers’ property.</p><p>While costs are dependent on the project, there is typically a higher overhead for permeable products, but over time, homeowners save money with less maintenance and easier repairs. There are numerous styles and patterns to choose from, making permeable pavers a customizable option. With concrete, homeowners will need to wait for it to cure, but <a href=""https://www.belgardcommercial.com/products/permeable_interlocking_concrete_pavers/eco_dublin"" target=""_blank"">permeable pavers</a> can be used immediately after installation. Many cities are now offering rebate programs and credits to homeowners who improve water quality through sustainable landscapes, stormwater management, and/or switching to porous pavement, such as Washington County in Minnesota, Portland, Oregon, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C. </p><p>As an added benefit, according to the Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute (ICPI), pavers are twice as strong as traditional concrete, which cracks easily. This extends the life of your driveway or patio.<br /> <br /><br /><strong>Benefits to Contractors </strong><br /><br />Contractors can profit from installing permeable pavers because they reduce the need for specialized installation equipment and curing mixtures. They can also be used to create <a href=""https://www.techo-bloc.com/shop/pavers/aquastorm/"" target=""_blank"">temporary roads</a> on construction sites, which is especially helpful during the springtime rainy season. On most job sites, you won’t need supplementary irrigation for surrounding plants, minimizing your labor costs. If there’s damage to a customer’s pavers, they are much easier to repair than traditional concrete as you can pull up the problem area, adjust the base, and relay the affected pavers.</p><p>Permeable pavers also support the administrative side of the business. Many municipalities impose “cover codes” and limit the percentage impervious surfaces can cover on a lot for both new construction and redevelopment jobs. These pavers allow you to cover more land while adhering to code. If laid properly with the correct fillers and careful installation, they are also <a href=""https://www.belgard.com/products/permeable-pavers/aqua-roc"" target=""_blank"">ADA compliant</a>.</p><p>Regular upkeep on these hardscapes is necessary for maximum performance, which makes recurring business simple. Set up routine maintenance visits with your client to avoid particle buildup in the joints. You can clear out sediment with vacuum sweeping and/or jet washes. </p><p><br /><strong>Have Customers Upgrade Today </strong><br /><br />For more information on the permeable paver installation process, visit your local <a href=""/stonecenter"">SiteOne Stone Center</a> for learning opportunities and supplies. </p><p></p></div>";cmsitem_00038006

;;cmsitem_00033029;"<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p> <img src=""/medias/sys_master/root/h3a/h84/9092869455902/article-stormwater-tools-2.jpg"" alt=""Stormwater Management: Runoff Tools"" height=""auto"" width=""100%""></p><br/><p>Be sure to prepare your clients for springtime storms that can bring excessive rainfall and flooding.<br /><br />As a contractor, you know that landscapes with proper drainage conserve irrigation and reduce pollutants. Ideally, the client’s drainage system should protect the property, maximize outdoor space usability, and prevent future storm water problems. According to NDS, proper stormwater management can prevent flood damage and increase the value of a home by up to 15%. If your client does not have a well-managed stormwater system, consider it a business opportunity, especially during the rainy spring months where runoff is plentiful. You could add a sizable increase to your bottom line by addressing some of these issues on your existing jobsites. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Initial Management Review</strong><br />Take time to call your clients after a storm while the runoff and ponding are top of mind. Before starting your work, take inventory of how the landscape reacts to rainwater and large storms. Identify potential/current issues by observing where the rain falls and how it flows through the yard, also noting where the surfaces interact and puddles form. Puddles should only last up to 24 hours, otherwise, you probably need to install drainage to remedy poor soil infiltration and/or too much runoff water. Before installing a drainage system, check if your customer has a septic system and ensure you do not disturb the leach field area or change the flow of water for the system. Also assess potential pollutant sites (i.e. a fertilized garden) and ensure that all utilities on the lot are clearly marked and accounted for. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Runoff </strong><br />Runoff from a home’s roof or gutter system is one of the most common stormwater problems. Remember to inspect these for any issues. Downspouts are typically ineffective alone in preventing runoff issues and can lead to washed out landscape beds, wet crawlspaces, foundation issues, and basement flooding. A downspout apron doesn’t push water far enough away from the area; ideally, you should install underground <a href=""/ads4730100bs-ads-drain-pipe-single-wall-perforated-4-in-with-sock-100-ft-/p/116140"">drainage piping</a> leading away from the home. While you can use aboveground piping, it can make mowing and trimming difficult. <br /><br />Evaluate the area around the downspouts. Is there vegetation that could cause debris to block the flow of water? If so, be sure to use a catch basin and adapter to ensure the piping does not get clogged and debris is filtered. These can be placed directly underneath or attached between the downspout and underground piping. Products like the <a href=""/1200dsg-nds-downspout-defender-plastic-basin-grate-self-cleaning-bla/p/594838"">NDS Downspout Defender</a> grate work wonders to maintain water flow in heavily treed areas where flat grates can become clogged and cause splash back. If you use a <a href=""/ads465aa-ads-downspout-adapter-4-in-x-4-14-in-x-3-in-black-hdpe/p/64338"">downspout adapter</a>, install one with an overflow or cleanout  to avoid backups if the adapter connects directly to the piping. <br /><br /><a href=""/dpuv3e-rain-bird-pop-up-drainage-emitter-3-in-with-elbow/p/336890"">Pop-up emitters</a> can be used at the end of your piping, like areas near curbs or sidewalks, to ensure the discharge flows into the street effectively. These emitters’ low profile don’t hamper lawn maintenance because they pop up from hydrostatic pressure, closing automatically when the pressure slows. This device also prevents small debris or animals from getting into the piping and causing clogs. <br />​​​​​​​<br />French drains are another potential solution. Consisting of an underground perforated pipe surrounded by gravel to direct runoff, they can be connected to emitters or dry wells depending on the location. Products like the <a href=""/ez-1501f-nds-ez-flow-engineered-french-drain-w-6-in-slotted-pipe/p/232078"">NDS EZ-Flow</a> French drain have adapted the time-tested method to save labor and money without compromising performance. <br /><br />There are some local ordinances that require owners to retain stormwater to avoid pollution in nearby water sources. In these cases, you might not be able to use an emitter leading to the street. Dry wells have been a historical solution, but a <a href=""/fwas24wh-nds-flo-well-dry-well-leaching-system-black-plastic-24-in-x-/p/334895"">Flo-Well</a> uses the same process more efficiently. A traditional drywell is filled with gravel and can hold 25 gallons of water, while the Flo-Well can hold 50 gallons in the same amount of space. These versatile systems allow the water to rejoin the groundwater, which is highly beneficial to tree roots and general soil health. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Best Practices</strong><br /><strong>Know your climate.</strong> The typical amount of rainfall is one of the biggest indicators of the kind of drainage needed. <br /><br /><strong>Know your soil. </strong>Soil cleanses water as it flows through, making infiltration techniques important. In order to clean the water passing through, the soil needs to effectively absorb it. Once it absorbs, you have less work to do in managing runoff. Soils with high clay content or compaction levels need more management techniques. <br /><br /><strong>Make a plan.</strong> Maintenance is key in stormwater management. Discuss routine maintenance visits with your client to ensure the system remains effective and efficient. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Benefits to Stormwater Management</strong><br />In addition to the business benefits previously mentioned, a solid drainage system can conserve the amount of irrigation needed by rerouting water to dryer areas and higher soil infiltration. This can also positively affect groundwater recharge, enhance wildlife habitats, and improve landscape aesthetics. Prepare your clients for the rainy spring season by ensuring their current drainage system is properly maintained, and if not, building out a system for them.  Shop SiteOne.com for all the drainage products mentioned above or stop into your local branch to sign up for an educational course today. <br /> </p></div>";cmsitem_00033029;;cmsitem_00033033;"<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p> <img src=""/medias/sys_master/root/h09/he6/9093178359838/article-stormwater-ponding3.jpg"" alt=""Stormwater Management: Ponding and Erosion Solutions"" height=""auto"" width=""100%""></p><br/>Ensure your clients have stormwater management systems in place for the spring storm season. <br /><br />The ideal property should create maximum outdoor space usability while properly managing water flow and preventing flooding issues. If clients don’t have a well-maintained system, take the opportunity to build one. Prevention is important to protect customer assets from stormwater damage, especially during the rainy spring season when flooding is prevalent. An inadequate stormwater system can cause serious harm to the client’s property and local water supplies.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Initial Landscape Review</strong><br />Before breaking ground, make sure to account for any problem areas on the property, ideally observing the landscape after a large storm. Note how the water flows through the yard and where it meets other surfaces to remedy any issues.  Ponding effects should last at most 24 hours; if they’re lasting longer, you will need to install drainage. You’ll also need to ensure all utilities are clearly marked and potential pollutant sites are assessed and protected from spreading, such as septic systems. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Ponding and Soil Erosion</strong><br />While runoff is a common problem, soil erosion is another widely seen stormwater issue. This can look like barren ground or soil swept away from house foundations and tree roots. Resolve erosion immediately as it only gets worse with time. Erosion can happen nearly anywhere on a client’s property, but two common locations are around the driveways and in landscape beds. <br /><br />If your client’s land has varied topography, adding terracing or a <a href=""/hardscapes"">retaining wall</a> lined with gravel or mulch to sloped areas protects the land and keeps the soil in place. The wall can be used as a multi-use feature, such as a bench or planter bed. Mulch can be added to all plant beds to protect bare soil and slow runoff. <br /><br />Choosing regional, low-growing vegetation for landscape beds slows down runoff, removes sediments, and has less rain impact on soil. Additionally, native vegetation minimizes potential for mosquitoes, stabilizes slopes with the plants’ root structure, and improves soil infiltration.<br /><br />Check to ensure that the current flora on the property doesn’t have root damage and there are no ponding effects. If a flowerbed is continuously wet and flooded, install drains to avoid damage to the yard and home. Round catch basins like the <a href=""/nds201-nds-spee-d-drain-basin-round-black-plastic-2-outlet-6-in/p/94209"">NDS Spee-D Drain Basin</a> have a sump area to collect debris before entering the drainage piping to protect water flow. If the installation area is not high traffic, catch basins with an atrium are ideal as they better block debris like mulch from clogging pipes. Flat basins work well in low spots in yard where there is ponding and can redirect water in high traffic areas. These basins could be connected to French drains, a <a href=""/fwas24wh-nds-flo-well-dry-well-leaching-system-black-plastic-24-in-x-/p/334895"">Flo-Well</a> system, emitters, or a combination of these options. <br /><br />If you have a client with a driveway that is often flooded or that has runoff draining into the street, this could not only damage their property and the roads but can also carry pollutants into natural water sources nearby. There are options to alleviate this issue and will depend on the client’s land, budget, and preferences. <br /><br />With driveways and patios with a gentle slope, you can install a <a href=""/nds820-5-in-x-20-in-channel-drain-shallow-profile/p/85700"">trench drain</a> to collect runoff during storms. This will avoid puddling and protect the client’s assets. Trench drains can lead to emitters or a Flo-Well system, but either way, the piping should have catch basins with sumps to allow the smaller debris that gets through to settle for removal. Consider asking your customer to switch to permeable paver stones or turf blocks for their driveway as an upsell. These materials help stormwater infiltrate the ground. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Stormwater Management Best Practices</strong><br />Keep a pulse on the climate and soil type in your area. Rainfall levels indicate what drainage is needed and the kind of soil will tell you how the water will be absorbed. Depending on soil type and compaction levels, you may need to add more management techniques to the system you’re building. <br /><br />Remember the rule of thumb: store, slow, spread, sink. Storing water is a great way to reduce demand for irrigation. Slowing down and spreading runoff prevents erosion, flash flooding, and other issues. Sinking (or infiltrating) the stormwater is one of the best things you can do for the environment as it aids aquifers in addition to helping the landscape thrive. <br 
/>Plan a maintenance routine with your client to ensure that the drainage system stays efficient. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Benefits to Stormwater Management</strong><br />Drainage is highly beneficial to homeowners as it protects their assets; maintenance is more affordable than fixing the damage erosion can cause. Ecologically, it helps the environment as well, positively affecting groundwater recharge, creating habitats, improving aesthetics, and rerouting water to areas with higher soil infiltration.

Based on the Greek word “xeros” which means dry, it’s a practice that involves landscaping with native, slow-growing, drought-resistant plants. It’s a system that can be used effectively in any climate but is particularly beneficial to dry areas like the Western United States. People have been using this method of landscaping for centuries, but it gained traction in the 1980’s when Denver Water coined the term. The utility wanted to promote less water usage during a multi-year drought, and eventually created the seven principles of xeriscaping:<br />​​​​​​​<ol><li>Sound landscaping planning and design</li><li>Limitation of turf/lawn to appropriate and functional areas</li><li>Use of water efficient plants</li><li>Efficient irrigation</li><li>Soil amendments</li><li>Use of mulches</li><li>Appropriate landscape maintenance</li></ol><br /><strong>Xeriscaping Benefits </strong><br /><br />There are many benefits to xeriscaping, but the top advantage by far is water conservation. An EPA study shows that the average American family uses 320 gallons of water a day, with 30% dedicated to landscaping. In the Southwest, outdoor water use can be up to 60%. National Geographic states that switching to a xeriscape can reduce water use by 50%-75%. Using a mixture of rocks and native plants is essential for landscapes that survive and thrive throughout times of high heat and droughts. Additionally, use of native plants should help soil infiltration, minimize mosquitoes, and even attract wildlife such as hummingbirds and butterflies. While many people associate xeriscapes with cacti and clay, there are many plants and looks you can go for in your project. For perennials in California, you can plant rosemary, lavender, Santa Barbara daisy, daffodils, and Mexican sage, among others. Honeysuckle and wisteria make for attractive climbing vines, and succulents like agave and aloe are beautiful in xeriscapes. <br /><br />In addition to saving money, homeowners save time with less maintenance. There is little turf used in xeriscapes, so there are less mowing and fertilizing needs. If a customer wants grass, species like blue oat grass and blue fescue grass have the same look but require less water and upkeep. For customers who enjoy annual color, you can install varieties like California poppies, lupine, clarkia, and larkspur that require little water, but still pack a colorful punch. <br /><br />Some drought prone cities give cash back or rebate incentives to landholders who install xeriscapes. Visit your local and state websites to see if this is available in your area.<br /><br /> <br /><strong>Contractor Opportunities </strong><br /><br />When you have happy customers, you have repeat business, even with low-maintenance xeriscapes. Xeriscaping is a great opportunity to incorporate hardscapes and <a href=""/protrade"">lighting</a> in addition to xeriscape work, so customers can minimize water usage but still have areas for entertaining. Depending on the property, regrading and irrigation system modification may be needed.<br /><br />If a customer wants to keep their sprinkler system, one efficient change is  to upgrade to high efficiency nozzles like <a href=""/he15van-rain-bird-he-van-high-efficiency-nozzle-12-ft-to-15-ft-radiu/p/315898"">Rain Bird HE-VAN nozzles</a>. These nozzles direct the spray in a much tighter fashion and prevent water loss from misting. If the customer wants to renovate their irrigation system, drip irrigation systems like the <a href=""/hdl0912250cv-hunter-hdl-dripline-check-valve-09-gph-12-in-250-ft/p/592268"">Hunter HDL Dripline</a> save a ton of water and is effective, as are micro-emitters. <br /><br />Rain sensors and <a href=""/smrt-y-rain-bird-moisure-sensor/p/182335"">soil moisture sensors</a> paired with a SMART irrigation controller are another smart irrigation upgrade. These will monitor the water levels and signal for the irrigation system to forgo watering when moisture levels are high, saving the customer money and water. <br /><br />While xeriscapes need less traditional maintenance to function properly, they will still need to be pruned and fertilized. Irrigation will need to be checked and serviced on a routine basis, <a href=""/landscape-supply-consumables/c/sh1211110"">mulching</a> will need to be redone yearly, and pest control is still going to be a factor to consider and charge for during maintenance visits.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Change Brings New Business</strong><br /><br />Xeriscaping is rapidly becoming more popular as water restrictions and regulations are put in place and more customers are thinking about helping the environment. As a business owner, adapting to the changing industry and expanding your services to meet customer requests will serve you well.  You probably have all the tools needed to offer this increasingly popular style of landscaping.

You might be surprised to discover how many of your customers have existing drainage issues and would appreciate your help for improving and protecting their properties. Open up the conversation with current customers to connect and walk through properties experiencing drainage issues, then begin discussing plans for assistance and improvement.<br /><br />Here is a breakdown of some of the most common issues to look for, as well as recommended solutions:<br /> <ul><li><strong>Downspout runoff</strong><ul><li>Look for flooding and erosion at downspout, structural damage from water, or ask your customer if the basement or crawlspace is damp/wet or has standing water in it.</li><li>Solution: A downspout adapter can transition water from downspout straight to pipe. For properties with trees overhanging rooftops, the NDS Downspout Defender™ Grate blocks tree debris to protect the pipeline from clogging. Installing a proper drainage system using a catch basin or low-profile adapter under the downspout and a pop-up emitter to release water downstream is recommended. </li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Water on hardscapes</strong><ul><li>Look for staining from mold and mildew, mud or debris accumulating on surfaces, water intrusion and/or structural damage. </li><li>Solution: Remove water from large, impervious surface areas such as pool decks, patios and driveways with a channel drain or trench drain. These long, narrow drains capture sheet-flow runoff from surrounding surfaces to prevent growth of slippery mildew, stains and costly property damage. Connect to a point of release downstream, such as a pop-up emitter. </li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>High groundwater and saturated soils</strong><ul><li>Look for a wet basement or crawlspace, water seeping through a retaining wall, or standing water over 24 hours after a rain event.</li><li>Solution: Capture and remove groundwater adjacent to foundations, behind retaining walls and in saturated yards with an EZflow® Gravel-Free French Drain System. These underground drainage solutions capture and redirect high groundwater away from structures and poor drainage areas. Connect to a discharge point downstream, such as a pop-up emitter. </li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Water collecting in lower areas of the yard, landscape beds or natural areas</strong><ul><li>Look for patchy turf and muddy areas, musty smells from fungus and disease, or turf that is yellowing, thinning or dying. </li><li>Solution: Collect standing water using a catch basin or low-profile adapter with a grate to block debris and direct water to pipe. For areas prone to flooding, other options include the Flo-Well® Dry Well System to collect, temporarily store and slowly release excess water into the ground, and the EZflow French Drain System. Drain away the excess water drowning plants or lingering in mulched plant beds using a catch basin or low-profile adapter with a domed atrium grate, and direct it to a pop-up emitter as a point of release.

This method provides the exact amount of water plants need to thrive while reducing waste and saving money. These systems use tubing and emitters to direct water flow. Emitters can be added anywhere on the lines, making drip irrigation a customizable option. </p><p>There are two main types of emitters- drip irrigation emitters and micro sprinklers. Both are installed in tubing and control the rate and amount of water released but differ in size. </p><p>Choosing the emitter to fit your customers’ needs is important. There’s porous piping, also called drip hose, which has small holes throughout the line and is easily installable and adjustable. This tubing type can have difficulty regulating water pressure. There’s also piping with pre-installed emitters inserted into the pipe at regular intervals, which are less prone to clogging than porous piping. Punch-in emitters allow you to place emitters anywhere by piercing the pipe. This kind of emitter is easily interchangeable if location and flow rates change. Drip emitters are one of the most popular types as they deliver a targeted and slow flow of water that seeps into the root system. Micro sprinkler heads and <a href=""/slv-pst-2-salco-pro-spec-micro-bubbler-emitter-dark-green-12-in-fipt-2/p/367764"">micro bubblers</a>, or low-volume sprayers, water landscapes with a fan-like spray. These are less efficient compared to emitters, but more efficient than high-pressure head sprinklers. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Benefits of Drip Irrigation </strong><br /><br />The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that micro irrigation systems use 20-50% less water than conventional sprinkler systems. Since the water goes directly into the ground in targeted locations instead of in the air or on walkways, there is very little water waste. These systems also require less water pressure, which can help save customers’ money. The EPA also states that a drip irrigation system can save a typical home over 25,000 gallons of water a year compared to a traditional system. </p><p>Additionally, with a drip irrigation system, you can work on other landscaping projects while the system is running, opening more time for your team to work on the jobsite. No trenches are needed; supply lines can sit on the ground or under a layer of mulch. They are also customizable and give customers flexibility to adjust as planter beds grow and change. Goof plugs can be used to stop holes if you need to reposition or terminate one of the lines. Using these systems, the water is absorbed deeply into the soil, so runoff issues and erosion risk is greatly reduced. Drip systems are typically operated with an <a href=""/tm2-6-rain-bird-controller-esp-tm2-indooroutdoor-6-station/p/487515"">irrigation controller</a> for ease of use.<br /> <br /><br /><strong>Things to Consider Before Installing </strong><br /><br />Irrigation flow rate needs will depend on soil type. Use ½ GPH (gallon per hour) drippers in clay soil, 1 GPH drippers in loam, and 2 GPH drippers in sandy soil.</p><p>Different plant beds have different needs depending on size and spacing of vegetation. Use spot water emitters with a higher flow rate for large shrubs and trees. Use medium flow-rate emitters for medium sized bushes around 24” wide. Use low-flow emitters for starter shrubs and flowers. </p><p>Spacing is important to recognize as well. If plants are close together, micro bubblers are a good choice. These have a larger coverage area that is easy to adjust if needed. For dense plantings, consider using ¼” emitter tubing. Gardens need more durability, so ½” tubing is recommended. For flowers and small plants, use staked micro sprayers, as these are gentle and adjustable for distance. <a href=""/0354025l-b-nla-netafim-vibronet-mister-53-gph-brown-nozzle-w-check-valve/p/197780"">Misters</a> should be used for delicate flowers and tropical plants. </p><p>To save time and money, drip irrigation systems can be outfitted into existing irrigation systems. Cap off old sprinkler heads and develop new points of connection for your customer’s drip system through existing piping. </p><p><br /><strong>Installation Process</strong><br /><br />Note that laying drip tube is easier before the spring season when plants are not fully blooming. </p><p>Start by choosing the type and flow rate of your customer’s system based on soil and plant needs. Build a plan to cover all root zones. Divide the yard into groups of plants with similar watering needs (hydrozones) and add a separate system per zone. </p><p>Begin your project at the end of the planter bed closest to the water supply. Install a backflow preventer to avoid contamination in potable water lines. Install a control valve or valves, then assemble a filter and a pressure reducer (which ensures constant water pressure) and attach these to the mainline pipe. Filters in drip systems are vital to ensure optimum performance. Set up <a href=""/30345-antelco-agri-drip-pc-emitters-1-gph/p/400942"">drip emitters</a> where necessary, then connect these to the mainline pipe also. Install manual flush valves to prevent debris blockages. Stake the drip line wherever needed and add tee or elbow fittings if piping needs to change directions. Purge the system to clear out any soil lodged during installation, then cap off the ends of the tubing. Set up an irrigation controller to provide a simple, regular watering schedule.</p><p></p><p><strong>Increase Profits with Smart Irrigation</strong><br /><br />Like all other irrigation systems, micro irrigation systems require annual maintenance to ensure efficiency, creating repeat business.

The basic concept of a <a href=""irrigation-controllers/c/sh1414?q=%3Arelevance%3AirgStationType%3A2-Wire&amp;searchtype=product&amp;viewtype=All&amp;Station+Type=on#"">two-wire controller</a> is the irrigation controller uses a single two-wire path to communicate to a decoder or output device and uses the same wire to provide power to each zone valve through the solenoid.  <br /><br />A traditional controller requires a dedicated wire between the controller and each zone valve connected to the controller.  Each valve must be linked through a common wire that runs back to the controller. This is a reliable and tested method of installing an irrigation system; however, there are several reasons you might consider a two-wire system for your next install: </p><ul><li>Traditional controller systems can use a lot of wire. As a dedicated wire and common wire are required for each zone or control valve, this can quickly add up, especially in larger systems. A two-wire system can use up to 70% less wire than traditional systems depending on coverage area.  This could mean lower installation and material costs for the same design and performance. <br /> </li><li>Long wire runs can be achieved with a two-wire system.  If you’re designing or installing a system that has zone valves a significant distance from the controller, rather than upsizing the station wire to a larger gauge, a two-wire system may be a better option.  Some manufactures can have wire runs of more than 1.5 miles with 14-gauge wire and 6.5 mile runs if you loop the wire.  <br /> </li><li>Two-wire systems can often communicate back and forth with the decoder or output device with real time operating and diagnostic information. Imagine, rather than spending hours looking for and troubleshooting a cut wire, the controller could identify the damage and direct you to a specific location on the wire path. <br /> </li><li>Other than the controller, two-wire systems are fully below ground systems.  This has several benefits including allowing the site to remain undisturbed with no above ground enclosures which can also limit vandalism risk. As everything “downstream” from the controller is below ground, this also limits the risk of water damage.  All the downstream, below-ground components are weatherproof and can be direct buried without worrying about damage. This can be especially useful if the system is being installed in a flood-prone area.<br /> </li><li>Two-wire systems are very easy to expand.  Rather than having to install a “home run” wire from the new zone valve back to the controller, a two-wire system only requires a connection from the existing two-wire path to add new zone valves (assuming there is capacity in the controller.)</li></ul>There are some areas to watch out for if you are installing your first two-wire system.  Since two-wire systems may have longer wire runs, the wire path needs to be protected from lightning induced surges. Each manufacturer has a unique specification on the grounding requirements for installation.  In addition to the grounding requirements, the wire splices need to be carefully installed on a two-wire system using direct bury connectors to the manufacturer’s specifications. Since the system is sending both power and communication on the same wire, poor connections can have a detrimental impact on the system operation.  In addition, as two-wire systems are completely below ground, a good installation drawing or “as-built drawing” is essential to maintain the system in the future. <br /><br />Two-wire technology continues to improve, and irrigation manufacturers are launching new products in the two-wire market each year. As a result, two-wire systems are becoming more price competitive and are a viable option for many projects from smaller residential installations through large commercial designs.<br /><br />SiteOne has the knowledge and products to support you as you explore two-wire installations. This category is expected to grow as technology improves; give yourself a competitive edge by learning two-wire irrigation installation now. <p></p></div>";cmsitem_00030009

;;cmsitem_00038011;"<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content""><p> <img src=""/medias/sys_master/root/h52/hf8/9101967261726/article-image-organic.jpg"" alt=""Benefits of Organic Fertilizer and Control Products"" height=""auto"" width=""100%""></p><br/><p>These days, many consumers are interested in organic products, including landscaping materials. According to the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) in the U.S., the term “organic” is only federally regulated for food or fiber products, not for non-food products like fertilizer, so it’s important to understand what qualifies as organic if customers express interest. Look for privately regulated standards from a trusted third-party non-profit like “OMRI listed” to ensure you are meeting organic standards. Many companies add words like sustainable, eco-friendly, and biodegradable to their packaging, but these terms do not mean these products are organic. </p><p>Organic fertilizer and organic control products are created from plant and animal waste (manure or compost) or powered minerals. Sometimes called soil conditioners, these are normally minimally processed natural ingredients, versus extracted or refined like synthetic products. Some examples include fish emulsion, cow and chicken manure, cottonseed meal, and bone meal, either as a single substance or a combination of such materials. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Benefits of Organic Fertilizer</strong><br /><br />Organic fertilizer is made of matter that helps microbes thrive; microbes are responsible for nutrient release. The most common organic matter used for fertilizer is carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Microbes decompose matter, use carbon to grow themselves, and release excess nutrients into the soil for plant use. </p><p>Soil structure can improve with organic fertilizer use because organic matter holds water more easily than synthetic, increases nutrient absorption, and produces less runoff. Organic fertilizer has a slow release, which means it absorbs into the soil at a rate that’s less likely to stress plants or overfertilize. With synthetic fertilizer, improper application can produce burn and impact surrounding water bodies. </p><p>Organic fertilizer can also help contractors follow nutrient pollution reduction criteria some states mandate. </p><p>Additionally, the Organic Trade Association states that organic fertilizer increases biodiversity by 30% compared to synthetic fertilizer. Biodiversity is important because it improves water entry and storage, curbs erosion, aids plant nutrition, and helps break down organic matter and cycle nutrients. <br /> <br /><br /><strong>Benefits of Organic Herbicide </strong><br /><br />Like organic fertilizer, <a href=""/nac25gal-avenger-non-selective-concentrate-omri-listed-organicweed-ki/p/652799"">organic herbicide</a> is also made up of natural matter. These work for total eradication of an area as it typically isn’t selective. </p><p>These work best on short and newly emerged plants, as a “second punch” for weeds that have been cut low, or as a follow up after smothering weeds. Mature plants will need multiple treatments. Organic herbicides are also safe to use as directed sprays applied around woody stems and tree trunks. Note that weather conditions matter- dry vegetation and direct sunlight help these products kill roots more effectively during the summertime and in early autumn. Plants have a higher potential for herbicide to be absorbed at the end of the growing season. UC Davis states that conditions are ideal with temperatures above 75 degrees.</p><p>Another perk of organic herbicide is that it dissipates in hours after job completion, not weeks or months like some synthetic counterparts. This means they don’t change the soil pH and won’t affect runoff. </p><p><br /><strong>Benefits of Organic Pesticide </strong></p><p>Also derived from naturally occurring sources, such as neem oil, diatomaceous earth, and pyrethin, organic pesticides are an excellent resistance management tool if used over time. Pests are less likely to develop resistance to these products versus synthetic ones, however, organic pesticides can require special handling. Consult your products label for specific guidance.  </p><p>Similar to herbicides, application timing is also very important with organic pesticides. Some products rely on being utilized at certain points within the pests’ lifecycles or they are ineffective. Once you familiarize yourself with product-specific requirements of organic pesticides, you can use this expertise to gain more business.</p><p>For more information and assistance in choosing the right organic products for your customers, visit the <a href=""/agronomic-maintenance/c/sh13"">agronomic maintenance section</a> of our website or your local branch today.<br /> </p><p></p></div>";cmsitem_00038011

With a little guidance and know-how, the process is relatively easy to add as a profitable service offering. Contractors report that the margins from outdoor lighting are better than almost all segments of existing services. SiteOne is illuminating the path with three steps: target customers, close the sale and feel confident in adding landscape lighting to your portfolio.<br /><br /><br /><strong>What is the ROI for You?</strong><br />Landscape lighting is a bright idea for you and your customer, especially as more and more homeowners look to expand outdoor living areas. It’s an affordable way to beautify your client’s home and create additional living space without costly renovations. Installing deck lights, hanging lights or path lights can create a memorable ambiance around eating and grilling areas, patios, pools and spas. Special effects created with up lights or in-ground well lights can enhance curb appeal and highlight hardscapes, architectural details and/or the great landscaping work that your team tackles for the customer. And when strategically positioned, outdoor light fixtures can make your clients’ home safer by lighting walkways, steps and entryways.<br /><br />When your business knows how to install lighting, it’s an added bonus for your customers. Since you are currently working for them, it means they don’t need to shop around for additional trusted professionals — you can service their lighting needs. Lighting can be sold as an additional component of new irrigation, maintenance or hardscape projects. It can be added as a profitable service to fill in the down months outside of the standard irrigation, maintenance or hardscape installation seasons and keep your crews busy. Finally, don’t limit “lighting” to the warm seasons. Every year, more homeowners are electing to hire a contractor to adorn their home in holiday lights. This is a growing segment that offers additional space to build profitably during the slower months. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Is Lighting Right for Your Customer?</strong><br />Yes. However, getting customers to understand and know it’s right for them takes a bit of legwork. Apply these three steps to help grow your customer base:<br /> <br />1.    Go back to the basics and find any opportunity to start; this could be your home or a friend or relative’s house. The key to successfully selling outdoor lighting — take lots of pictures. Before and after pictures of any project can spark the emotion while satisfying the reason in a customer’s brain. Consider giving early clients, even friends or family, a discount to allow the house to be used in your marketing efforts (Friendly reminder: don’t forget to ask for permission!). <br /><br />2.    Review previous accounts you have completed work for. A good customer from a past project will be willing to work with you on this new endeavor.  <br /><br />3.    Once a target customer has been identified, ask lots of questions. What do they want to do with their lighting project? What is the budget? If no budget is available, put together two versions (simple and full coverage) of a proposal — it’s likely you will land somewhere in the middle. Other questions to ask include: Where is the power source? What is the function of the space you want to illuminate? Do you anticipate expanding the space or adding additional lighting in the next two to three years? Do you live in a community that has lighting restrictions such as dark sky or sea turtle protection?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Is There an Easy Way to Sell Lighting? </strong><br />Most of the time when you buy a product, you know what you’re getting. But with outdoor lighting, homeowners often don’t fully understand the true value of a well-designed and properly installed outdoor lighting system. The solution is summed up in three words — Lighting Demo Kits (call your SiteOne branch to obtain a kit). <br /><br />Contractors report that when demo kits were requested by the homeowner, they experienced a closing rate over 80 percent. And when the contractor presented the lighting kit (without the homeowner asking for it), they still realized a higher closing rate of more than 35 percent. Talk about a win-win! There are five tips that will aid in completing the sale of the job:<br /> <ol><li>Always schedule your installation during the day. Then, return in the evening to showcase the setup to your clients. With this approach, you can present the system after dark, when the lighting effects will be most dramatic.<br /> </li><li>Choose a specific area to illuminate. You want to ensure that you’re highlighting a few focal points, instead of partially lighting a larger area. A great way to do this is by having a simple conversation with the homeowners.<br /> </li><li>After dusk, give the lighting system a test run. Adjust the lights as needed before the big reveal. When everything is perfect, turn off the lights. Then, bring the homeowners outside. Finally, with everyone standing in the dark, turn on all the lights at once. <br /> </li><li>If you’re using a demo kit with control capabilities, take time to engage the homeowners on the zoning, dimming and color capabilities of the system. Be sure to install the app on their phone(s) and pre-set any themes in advance. Put the control at their fingertips so they can freely toggle between themes and change lighting effects.<br /> </li><li>Leave the lights up for several days or, ideally, over a weekend. You want the homeowners to enjoy the lighting and get used to having it. You also want to provide enough time for their neighbors to see it or, better yet, for the homeowners to invite their neighbors over.</li></ol><br />Using lighting demo kits are the fastest and easiest way to show homeowners exactly what lighting will bring to their outdoor living spaces. And if you’re new to lighting, it’s the best way to practice lighting techniques.<br /><br />You have the tools to get the job done, but you need the know-how. SiteOne has the resources and people on standby to navigate the process as a lighting contractor, including: <ul><li>Lighting courses through <a href=""/events"">SiteOne University</a>.</li><li>Skilled lighting experts ready to answer any questions at your SiteOne Landscape Supply branch. </li><li>Design support from manufacturers or a member of our team. </li><li>Technical support from the manufacturer. </li><li>Extensive product inventory and availability on <a href=""/lighting"">SiteOne.com/lighting</a>. </li></ul><br />SiteOne has done the legwork so you can equip your team to conquer new challenges and drive your business to the next frontier of outdoor lighting. </div>";cmsitem_00040002

Depending on technique, results range from delicate porcelain tea sets to dense, durable non-porous finishing material used for hardscapes.<br /> </p><h3>Benefits of Porcelain for Customers</h3><p><strong>Customization</strong><br />Porcelain is highly customizable. It is available in multiple sizes and shapes and can be installed with narrow grout joints for a sleek, seamless look that many customers appreciate. Porcelain also has the added benefit of being more uniform in size and color than other materials due to being manufactured. This allows manufacturers to control finishes, which are most commonly interpretations of natural wood and stone, but can take on any look. </p><p>There is a newer trend in hardscaping to create outdoor spaces that seamlessly flow into indoor spaces, and porcelain pavers are the ideal product to create that aesthetic. <a href=""/hardscapes"">Belgard tiles</a> coordinate with indoor tiles, indoor/outdoor porcelain wall veneers, and trim for steps and pool coping to create a cohesive design. </p><p><strong>Easy Maintenance</strong><br />While porcelain tiles might sound great for your customers based on looks, they are also easy to clean and stain resistant. The normal cleaning procedure is a simple sweep and hose down. These pavers are resistant to acids, bases, and salts (including pool additives and household detergents). Most porcelain pavers do not require treatment or upkeep, so they are a practical choice for both residential and commercial applications as sealing isn’t a factor. This saves customers money, especially as an alternative to natural materials like marble, granite, slate, or travertine. </p><p><strong>Tough and Durable</strong> <br />Tough and durable, porcelain is far more resistant to erosion, scratching, and chipping than other hardscaping materials, especially concrete pavers. Chipping is also usually less noticeable than it would be in ceramic tiles due to the uniform color of porcelain. According to Belgard, porcelain can handle incredibly high breakage loads of up to 20,000 pounds. This makes porcelain pavers an excellent choice for gardens, terraces, and high-traffic outdoor areas. </p><p>Porcelain tiles are also impervious and according to the ATSM International C373 test method, have a water absorption rate of .5% or less, which is excellent. Ceramic typically has a higher water absorption rate than this. Natural stone water absorption rates vary greatly, but as an example, limestone has an average water absorption rate around 4.5%.</p><p>Because porcelain is non-porous, it is stain and moisture resistant. When created with a texture, it is also skid-resistant, making it a safer option in areas with lots of moisture and high traffic. When fired in a kiln, the tiles have a glaze that stops the water from penetrating the tile. This makes porcelain hold up to water much better than natural stone or cement, great for a pool deck, areas with heavy rain, or around irrigation systems. Non-porous means these porcelain pavers withstand extreme conditions and big shifts in weather, such as thaw-and-freeze cycles. Conversely, a quality of porcelain that is often overlooked is fire-resistance. Porcelain’s baking process involves over 60 minutes of exposure at 1,200 degrees Celsius, so it’s capable of withstanding extreme heat and won’t become damaged from expansion and contraction. Additionally, porcelain pavers are UV and fade resistant because of the high temperature at which they’re glazed. In hot sun, they stay cool on your feet longer than other materials and color will remain intact through decades of sun exposure. </p>Far denser than other comparable materials, these pavers are also anti-microbial and resist mold because there are no pores, unlike concrete and stone pavers. This makes porcelain pavers an excellent choice for pool surrounds to resist bacteria growth. <br /><br /><h3>Benefits to Contractors</h3><p>Consider offering porcelain pavers as a hardscape upsell opportunity. Porcelain is available in larger formats for your convenience. It can also be dry-laid into grass, gravel, dirt, and sand, making it easy to install. Porcelain pavers can also be installed onto terraces using raised supports without grout, adhesives, or specialized workers, saving you time and money.

Sound dramatic? It's really not when you think about the potential danger of consuming water not suitable for drinking. Many states now require the installation of a backflow preventer on every sprinkler irrigation system. A properly installed backflow preventer protects a home's pure drinking water supply by stopping contaminated water from mixing with the drinking water. Understanding what backflow is how it occurs and how to stop potentially dangerous backflow situations will help to avoid problems in your clients' drinking water.</p> <p><strong>What is Backflow and how does it occur?</strong></p><p>When nonpotable water or other substances flow through a cross-connection and into the piping of a public water system or consumer's potable water system it is called backflow. Backflow can be caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the supply pressure or by negative pressure (a vacuum). Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps temperature increases in boilers etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied such as during water line flushing fire fighting or breaks in water mains. Backsiphonage (a vacuum) can occur when there is a stoppage of water supply due to nearby fire fighting a break in a water main etc.</p><p><strong>How can I stop potentially dangerous backflow situations or avoid them all together?</strong></p><p>Irrigation systems make watering lawns and gardens easier and save time BUT water that may be contaminated by weed killers and/or fertilizers can backflow into the home's drinking water. Irrigation systems not protected by approved backflow prevention assemblies could endanger the health of a household neighborhood or community. Steps can be taken to prevent this dangerous situation.</p><p>First ensure that a proper backflow preventer is installed and maintained. A backflow preventer is a mechanism to prevent backflow which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly the pressure vacuum breaker assembly and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p><p>All irrigation systems new or existing should be equipped with an approved backflow prevention assembly. Only properly installed state-approved backflow prevention assemblies meet the plumbing code and provide health protection for family and neighbors.</p></div>";cmsitem_00039026

It’s recommended to determine the source of the noise before starting any work.</p><p>Water hammer is caused by an increase in pressure within water systems. A form of hydraulic shock, energy transformed into surge pressure produces a shock wave from a sudden change or stop in flow that spreads through the system and creates pounding noises within the pipes. The larger the changes in velocity, the greater the pressure. This can be caused by valve operation, starting and stopping pumps, directional changes from pipe fittings, heavy mineral buildup and rust inside shut off valves, air in pipes, or too much water in an air chamber. </p><p>It’s imperative to catch water hammer quickly, as it can cause costly damage. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Probable Sources </strong><br /><br />There are many different causes of water hammer. If new work is completed, it could be caused by poorly secured pipework. Wear of certain valve types, such as ball and float valves, fast acting valves, and worn stop valves can potentially create issues as can design errors. Lastly, trapped air within a system can build up pressure, leading to water hammer also.<br /> <br /><br /><strong>Potential Damage </strong><br /><br />Water hammer can inflict a wide range of problems, including damage to pumps, valves, instruments, and failure of joints. The integrity of pipe walls and welded joints can be compromised. Leaks are common with water hammer and can damage other equipment, increase in intensity, and are easily missed early. It can also rupture pipes and cause system failure if not fixed in a timely manner. External property damage is also something to be wary of with water hammer, as leaks and ruptured pipes can lead to washouts, property damage, or slip and fall accidents.  </p><p><br /><strong>Methods to Fix Water Hammer</strong></p><p>Because of the numerous system designs there is not a one-size-fits-all water hammer fix. Check your customer’s system to determine where the water hammer is occurring, then plan based on their system. </p><div style=""margin-left: 50px;""><p><em>Reduce System Pressure</em><br />If they’re noticing water hammer in their irrigation system, try lowering the system pressure. This reduces water demand for the sprinklers, reducing velocity in the pipes and therefore reducing water hammer. While this will reduce the overall surge pressure, it doesn’t eliminate it. To do this, turn the main shut-off valve of the sprinkler system to 50%, then run the system. Close the valve incrementally until the water hammer goes away. Ensure the sprinklers are still running effectively and emitting water the proper distance. If the sprinklers are not running well or not spraying water far enough, you will need to try another solution. </p><p>However, if the irrigation system works, test and see if there are any other issues in your customer’s house due to the change in demand from the irrigation system. If all is well, install an adjustable <a href=""/1-nr3xlhrsc-wilkins-nr3xlhrsc-high-range-pressure-reducing-valve-with-se/p/310004"">pressure reducing valve</a> after the shut-off valve you partially closed. Note that shut-off valves should not be left partially closed long-term, so be sure that you have all parts necessary for the job. Once done, open the shut-off valve fully and adjust the pressure reducing valve until the pressure works well for the irrigation system, but is low enough to prevent water hammer. This valve will compensate for the changes in water pressure. </p><p>If one valve zone of the sprinkler system creates water hammer, try incrementally closing the flow control stem on the irrigation control valve. If this stops the water hammer, you can leave this partially closed permanently. </p><p><em>Reduce Zone Run Order</em><br />With an automated irrigation system, try changing the order in which the valves run. Find the valve that uses the least amount of water (usually the one with the fewest sprinklers) and rewire the controller to run that valve last. Because water hammer is related to water flow, the valve with the least amount of flow is less likely to cause it when the valve closes. </p><p><em>Split Valve Zones</em><br />If an irrigation valve is causing the water hammer, split the valve zones. Reducing the number of sprinkler heads that the valve operates reduces the water velocity. Install a second valve and connect half of the sprinklers from the old valve to the new valve. Before trenching and installing pipe, be sure to run a check to see if this solution fits the system’s needs. Remove and cap off sprinkler heads and turn the valve off and on a few times to check for water hammer. Ideally, this should be done at the time water hammer is most prevalent in the system. If the water hammer disappears, ensure the second valve you install has the same number of sprinklers or fewer than the original. </p><p>If there is water hammer coming through multiple valves, you can split the valves with problems into two valve zones or you can install new, larger piping for the system. Check all piping from the water main to the valves to see if there is a section of pipe smaller than the rest. If found, replace that piping with a pipe double the original size to ensure lower velocity flow. If there’s not a section of smaller pipe, you may need to redo all the irrigation piping. Test install the new pipe before digging by running it aboveground first to see if the new pipe stops the water hammer.</p></div><p></p><br /><img src=""/medias/sys_master/root/hc5/h9d/9109402714142/article-waterhammer-graphic.jpg"" style=""width:100%"" /><br /><br /><p><strong>Methods of Prevention</strong><br /><br /><strong>Replace or install piping with air chambers.</strong> Air chambers are a short pipe segment with an empty air chamber that serves as a shock absorber for water to expend after sudden directional changes.</p><p><strong>Flush old systems. </strong>Stale, sitting water can have sediment sitting in it, especially if there is a lower flow. It takes very little debris to create a valve failure or stop up drip emitters, misters, and bubblers; sand is a major culprit of ruining new systems quickly. Ensure you’re flushing the system over a long enough period to wash out all the debris. </p><p>A <a href=""/accusyncadj-hunter-accusync-pressure-regulator-adjustable-20-to-100-psi/p/253469"">pressure regulator</a> and pressure reducer can be installed as well to reduce operating pressure.</p><p><strong>Stay Alert.</strong> Prevention and quick action are key with water hammer issues.

If clients don’t have a well-maintained system, take the opportunity to build one. Prevention is important to protect customer assets from stormwater damage, especially during the rainy spring season when flooding is prevalent. An inadequate stormwater system can cause serious harm to the client’s property and local water supplies.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Initial Landscape Review</strong><br />Before breaking ground, make sure to account for any problem areas on the property, ideally observing the landscape after a large storm. Note how the water flows through the yard and where it meets other surfaces to remedy any issues.  Ponding effects should last at most 24 hours; if they’re lasting longer, you will need to install drainage. You’ll also need to ensure all utilities are clearly marked and potential pollutant sites are assessed and protected from spreading, such as septic systems. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Ponding and Soil Erosion</strong><br />While runoff is a common problem, soil erosion is another widely seen stormwater issue. This can look like barren ground or soil swept away from house foundations and tree roots. Resolve erosion immediately as it only gets worse with time. Erosion can happen nearly anywhere on a client’s property, but two common locations are around the driveways and in landscape beds. <br /><br />If your client’s land has varied topography, adding terracing or a <a href=""/hardscapes"">retaining wall</a> lined with gravel or mulch to sloped areas protects the land and keeps the soil in place. The wall can be used as a multi-use feature, such as a bench or planter bed. Mulch can be added to all plant beds to protect bare soil and slow runoff. <br /><br />Choosing regional, low-growing vegetation for landscape beds slows down runoff, removes sediments, and has less rain impact on soil. Additionally, native vegetation minimizes potential for mosquitoes, stabilizes slopes with the plants’ root structure, and improves soil infiltration.<br /><br />Check to ensure that the current flora on the property doesn’t have root damage and there are no ponding effects. If a flowerbed is continuously wet and flooded, install drains to avoid damage to the yard and home. Round catch basins like the <a href=""/nds201-nds-spee-d-drain-basin-round-black-plastic-2-outlet-6-in/p/94209"">NDS Spee-D Drain Basin</a> have a sump area to collect debris before entering the drainage piping to protect water flow. If the installation area is not high traffic, catch basins with an atrium are ideal as they better block debris like mulch from clogging pipes. Flat basins work well in low spots in yard where there is ponding and can redirect water in high traffic areas. These basins could be connected to French drains, a <a href=""/fwas24wh-nds-flo-well-dry-well-leaching-system-black-plastic-24-in-x-/p/334895"">Flo-Well</a> system, emitters, or a combination of these options. <br /><br />If you have a client with a driveway that is often flooded or that has runoff draining into the street, this could not only damage their property and the roads but can also carry pollutants into natural water sources nearby. There are options to alleviate this issue and will depend on the client’s land, budget, and preferences. <br /><br />With driveways and patios with a gentle slope, you can install a <a href=""/nds820-5-in-x-20-in-channel-drain-shallow-profile/p/85700"">trench drain</a> to collect runoff during storms. This will avoid puddling and protect the client’s assets. Trench drains can lead to emitters or a Flo-Well system, but either way, the piping should have catch basins with sumps to allow the smaller debris that gets through to settle for removal. Consider asking your customer to switch to permeable paver stones or turf blocks for their driveway as an upsell. These materials help stormwater infiltrate the ground. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Stormwater Management Best Practices</strong><br />Keep a pulse on the climate and soil type in your area. Rainfall levels indicate what drainage is needed and the kind of soil will tell you how the water will be absorbed. Depending on soil type and compaction levels, you may need to add more management techniques to the system you’re building. <br /><br />Remember the rule of thumb: store, slow, spread, sink. Storing water is a great way to reduce demand for irrigation. Slowing down and spreading runoff prevents erosion, flash flooding, and other issues. Sinking (or infiltrating) the stormwater is one of the best things you can do for the environment as it aids aquifers in addition to helping the landscape thrive. <br /><br />Plan a maintenance routine with your client to ensure that the drainage system stays efficient. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Benefits to Stormwater Management</strong><br />Drainage is highly beneficial to homeowners as it protects their assets; maintenance is more affordable than fixing the damage erosion can cause. Ecologically, it helps the environment as well, positively affecting groundwater recharge, creating habitats, improving aesthetics, and rerouting water to areas with higher soil infiltration.

Whether you will need a separate shut off valve for a drip system depends on if you are replacing an entire sprinkler system or adding drip to your customer’s current irrigation system. If your customer wants to replace their entire system, you can use the existing shut off valve and retrofit control valves for the new drip system. <br /><br />If you’re adding drip into a lawn sprinkler system, it’s recommended to have a separate shut off valve. In this process, create a separate zone with a control valve or pressure reducing valve and filtration unit at the start of the zone to keep this separate from the sprinkler zone valves. This is necessary because drip systems and sprinkler systems aren’t compatible; they operate at different pressures and run times.   <br /><br />In either scenario, you can retrofit sprinklers by capping off spray heads around planter beds if they are placed after the pressure reducer and filter. Then driplines can be run from existing pipes.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Why do I need a pressure regulator with a drip irrigation system?</strong><br />Most drip systems operate at a lower water pressure than standard irrigation systems use. According to Green Industry Pros Magazine, most manufacturers recommend a maximum of 40 PSI for drip systems. Check the flow rate and use a pressure meter to gauge customers’ pressure at the water source.</p><p>Using a pressure regulator, also called a pressure regulating valve, lowers pressure and keeps it consistent. Without this, the fittings can pop off, emitters can become distorted, and the system will not work effectively. </p><p>There are three types of pressure regulators. Make sure you buy the correct regulator for your customer’s needs. The first is non-adjustable pressure regulators. These are best for small residential drip systems with fewer than three control valves. These <a href=""/pr40hf5f5fv-senninger-high-flow-pressure-regulator-10-32-gpm-1-14-in-fip/p/298125"">non-adjustable pressure regulators</a> have specific flow ranges and will not work if the flow is higher or lower than its specified range. They are normally made of plastic and have a pre-set outlet pressure. Install these after the control valve. If there’s more than one control valve, you’ll need a pressure regulator for each one. If a non-adjustable pressure regulator is installed before a control valve, the pressure regulator could have pressure surge, which can potentially damage the whole system. </p><p><a href=""/accusyncadj-hunter-accusync-pressure-regulator-adjustable-20-to-100-psi/p/253469"">Adjustable pressure regulators</a> are more flexible and accurate than non-adjustable regulators. These are typically brass or bronze and have a large screw to adjust outlet pressure. Like any regulator, ensure you buy the correct size for the job’s necessary flow rate specified by the manufacturer. You can install adjustable pressure regulators before or after the control valve. On larger drip systems with multiple control valves, the valves are often grouped together, and one adjustable pressure regulator is installed on the mainline before all the valves in a group to save money and time. Regulators require a pressure drop between the inlet and outlet of the regulator to operate effectively. If the pressure drop is less than required, the regulator will work less accurately, and pressure may substantially vary. </p><p>Some irrigation manufacturers offer a <a href=""/xcz100prf-rain-bird-xcz-medium-flow-control-zone-kit-with-1-in-dv-valv/p/99585"">drip control zone kit</a> which provides all the components necessary for on/off control, filtration, and pressure regulation in a single package, making them simple to order and easy to install. Drip control zone kits are preassembled with a filter, valve, and pressure regulator for a complete control zone solution. These kits come in a variety of flow ranges and have different capabilities from small residential installations to commercial projects. </p><p>Visit your local SiteOne branch or the <a href=""/irrigation"">irrigation section of our website</a> today to make sure you have the right tools and parts for your next drip irrigation installation job.<br /> </p></div>";cmsitem_00039002

The National Pest Management Association forecast employs entomologists to project seasonal pest pressure based on weather patterns, long term forecasts, and pest behaviors. Prepare your customers and boost business with pest management services. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Ticks </strong><br /><br />Ticks live all over the United States, but are most common in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic,and Upper Midwest based on Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting. Ticks can spread germs with lifecycles up to 3 years, and the CDC states that ticks are spreading more disease in recent years. In the Northeast, New England, and the north Central U.S. the warm, wet spring led into a mild, wet summer which has caused tick populations to thrive. The mild Great Lakes spring followed by a warm and wet summer and increased rainfall in the Northwest also shows an increase in tick activity. </p><p>Best treatment practices depend on the type of tick, but a good first line of defense is to eliminate sources of standing water, repair all holes that could serve as entry points into the property, and using <a href=""/210117-lesco-tick-free-insecticide-36-oz/p/700671"">LESCO Tick Free insecticide</a>.<br /><br /> <br /><strong>Mosquitos </strong><br /><br />According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mosquitos spread more diseases than any other type of insect and are responsible for several million deaths and hundreds of millions of illnesses a year. West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and Zika are the most common diseases spread by mosquitos in U.S. Higher temperatures and increased rainfall in the spring and summer across the U.S. leads to more mosquito activity across regions. Higher temperatures in the north Central U.S. will also lead to more stinging insects overall. Mosquitos are resilient and can survive in all kinds of climates, but particularly thrive near water. Many home landscapes are conducive to mosquito breeding.</p><p>To treat for mosquitos, check for standing water on customer’s property and remediate problem areas quickly. These can span between lawn drainage issues and much smaller ones. Mosquitos can lay eggs within little amounts of water, such as water collection in flowerpot saucers and even fallen leaves within the landscape. Once all sources of water are dried out or removed, put down insecticide like <a href=""/210115-lesco-mosquito-free-insecticide-36-oz/p/732998"">LESCO Mosquito Free insecticide</a>. If you need any help regarding drainage services, visit your local branch or <a href=""/equippedfordrainage"">our drainage resource center</a> today.  </p><p><br /><strong>Termites </strong><br /><br />Termites, also known as “silent destroyers,” chew through wood undetected. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that termites cause billions of dollars in damage each year, and homeowners spend around two billion a year in treatments. Often these treatments and repairs are not covered by homeowner’s insurance. Northeast/New England may see higher termite activity due to wet spring and summer and the warm, wet spring south Central U.S. can possibly start early termite activity. Additionally, the rainy spring and summer in the Southeast create ideal conditions for infestation.</p><p>Note that each state has specific license requirements to apply termiticides. This licensing is usually governed through the State Department of Agriculture. Be sure you have the correct licensing before you begin offering termiticide services.</p><p>To treat for termites, begin with an initial inspection and report. Once a thorough inspection has been done, put a chemical soil treatment around perimeter of building. Depending on the structure and the damage inflicted, organize termite baiting and/or colony extermination. After extermination, begin working on any building modifications and maintenance needed and complete regular follow up inspections to ensure the infestation does not return.  </p><p><br /><strong>Ants </strong><br /><br />Ants are attracted to moisture and humidity, two common summer conditions. A hot summer in Northeast and New England will bring more ants inside buildings, as will drier conditions in the South and upper Midwest. Wet conditions in South and the mild spring in the Northwest will lead to thriving ant populations. In the Southwest, cooler conditions and increased spring/summer rainfall could bring ants indoors. </p><p>To treat for ants, eliminate standing water around customer’s homes and inspect gutters and downspouts for proper function. Moist, decaying wood is prime nesting for carpenter ants. Once you’ve ensured good drainage and cleared out any stumps or branches from the yard, also check pathways and driveways for pavement ants. If you’ve noticed ants in a customer’s lawn, put down insecticide such as <a href=""/53212-syngenta-advion-fire-ant-insecticide-bait-2-lb/p/365188"">Syngenta Advion Fire Ant Insecticide</a>. </p><p><br /><strong>Cockroaches </strong><!--%0A--><br /><br />Cockroaches are weather resistant and can trigger allergies and asthma with their saliva, droppings, and decomposing bodies. They are difficult to kill: they can live for a week without a head, live without food for a month, not breathe for 40 minutes, and run up to 3 mph. There are 4,000 different species worldwide, but the most common is the German cockroach. The warm, wet Southeast summer will lead to increased outdoor cockroach populations that may move into structures, and the drier south-Central U.S. summer could drive cockroaches indoors in search for moisture. Cockroaches are often linked to disease; they’re known to spread at least 33 different bacteria (including E. coli and salmonella), six kinds of parasitic worms, and at least seven other human pathogens. Additionally, cockroaches breed at a rate of up to six generations a year. </p><p>Because the quick growth and unsanitary nature of cockroaches, treatment should take place immediately. Seal all entrances to building/structure (especially around utility pipes) and ventilate crawl spaces to prevent excess moisture. Put down insecticide like <a href=""/53206-advion-gel-cockroach-bait-4-x-30-gm/p/415887"">Advion Gel Cockroach Bait</a>. Be sure to also check for and eliminate any sources of standing water near the property.<br /> </p><p><strong>Springtails </strong><br /><br />Springtails are also called snow fleas. These pests are common around moist areas like pools with vegetation close by, leaky pipes, and any standing water. Snow fleas will not cause structural damage or spread disease but are still a nuisance and could indicate a larger moisture issue. Southwest’s cooler conditions and increased spring/summer rainfall could let springtail populations prosper.</p><p>To treat for snow fleas, first look for any moisture issues surrounding clients’ homes. If found, fix immediately. Remove any decaying matter from yard (i.e. wet logs or continuously damp piles of soil) as these attract snow fleas. Seal up any entry points that could allow indoor access and tighten leaky A/C drainpipes as well. </p><p><br /><strong>Stock Up at SiteOne </strong><!--{C}%3C!%2D%2D%250A%2D%2D%3E--><br />Pest management is an easy add-on to your business and provides immense value to customers.

At different pressures, the head and nozzle will use different amounts of water. Test the water pressure closest to the time of day the property will run the irrigation system. While you can use a pressure gauge to measure this yourself if possible, it’s ideal to meet with a water purveyor who uses a computer model to predict pressure. With this tool, they can provide data regardless of season and you can better predict pressure changes in the future. An ideal pressure range is 40-60 PSI. To check flow rate and flow loss, use a pipe flow loss chart. Check manufacturer recommendations for sprinkler performance. If there is not enough available capacity for the new additional sprinkler, add a new zone. </p><p>Begin by flushing out pipes and turning off the water supply. Excavate soil around the pipe where you want to install the head. Be careful to not damage the pipe in the process. Use ratcheting cutters or a hacksaw to cut section of PVC pipe wide enough to insert a coupling and tee-fitting. The fitting will need a threaded outlet for the riser. Glue the tee-fitting onto the open end of pipe and the slip-fix coupling to the other end. Adjust to fit pipes as needed and ensure tee is facing straight up, as cement dries fast. Use the same height riser as the rest of the line; wrap riser threads with pipe-thread tape and screw it into the tee fitting. Using a swing assembly or a flex pipe instead of a riser may be a helpful option to adjust the sprinkler head to grade. These pieces are easy to adjust and act like an “extension cord” to the pipe and the sprinkler head. </p><br /><img width=""100%"" src=""/medias/sys_master/root/h34/hf7/9116414705694/learn-sprinkler-infographic.jpg""><br /><p><br /><strong>Careful Considerations</strong></p><p>Always check for gas pipes or electrical cables before digging. Sprinkler heads and nozzles must be the same kind throughout the zone or have a matched precipitation rate, otherwise you run the risk of uneven watering. This can lead to runoff issues and/or dry patches on the lawn. During install, don’t bend the riser tubes too much as they tend to straighten back out and may dislodge the sprinkler. </p><p><br /><strong>Ask SiteOne</strong></p><p>If you have any questions about the installation process or the parts needed, don’t hesitate to ask your local SiteOne branch associate.
