<p>1. <strong><a href=""https://www.siteone.com/en/46005-king-innovations-gorilla-wire-stripper-with-locking-handle/p/43663"" target=""_blank"">Wire stripper</a> </strong>- You&rsquo;ll be using this quite a bit when installing lighting so make sure to find yourself a solid, durable tool. You can even find some that automatically gauge the wire diameter so you never need to worry about stripping any interior wire from the bundle.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Crimp tool</strong> &ndash; Use to simultaneously combine the individual wires you&rsquo;ve exposed during stripping so the connection can be made and electrical current can flow through the fixture(s).</p>
<p>3. <strong><a href=""https://www.siteone.com/en/4327-nebo-nebo-socketscrewdriver-set-pressure-range-color-dimensions-/p/440326"" target=""_blank"">6-in-1 Screwdriver</a></strong>&nbsp;- Reduce the number of trips back and forth to your truck or toolbox with multi-use tips that fit all of the standard screw types. You&rsquo;ll be using this for just about every lighting install, so look for models with a comfortable grip and a secure connection mechanism between the attachable tips and handle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. <strong>Silicone filled connectors</strong> &ndash; Seen as one of the more reliable lighting connector types, this component typically consists of two parts: &nbsp;a cap that combines the cut ends of wire and a separate, silicone gel-filled cover that keeps the cap in place and prevents moisture intrusion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. <strong>12 Gauge low voltage landscaping wire</strong> &ndash; To determine how much wiring you will need, consider the run length or distances between your transformer and the locations of your fixtures. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also smart to add extra wire (typically ~3ft) at each fixture in the event you want to move your lights as plantings mature or additional hardscape features are added. &nbsp;</p>
<p>6. <strong>Voltmeter voltage detector</strong> &ndash; Use this tool to determine if you&rsquo;re connected to the proper voltage tap on your transformer and trouble-shoot issues as needed. &nbsp;The voltage range to field wires (those running between fixtures) should be 9-15v for LED fixtures and 10-12v for halogen lamps. &nbsp;If you find the Voltmeter reading below the minimums for your fixture type connect your main supply wire to the higher voltage transformer tap. &nbsp;</p>
<p>7. <strong>Wire and edging trencher</strong>- This specialized, flat shovel that allows you to dig shallow trenches for wiring (6&rdquo;-8&rdquo;deep). &nbsp;This will help make your install faster and easier as you won&rsquo;t be exerting energy digging any deeper than needed. &nbsp;The objective is to protect the wire by burying it a few inches underground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the job there may be other accessories and tools useful for your install. &nbsp;For example, running wiring through buried PVC conduit can be helpful in areas around edging where digging is anticipated. &nbsp;<a href=""https://www.siteone.com/en/lighting/c/sh11"" target=""_blank"">Shop SiteOne Staged</a> or ask a SiteOne Associate at your local branch about the other lighting accessories and tools most suited to your lighting project.</p></div>

<p>Have you ever wondered why you didn't get the sale? Have you ever kept track of the reasons why?</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>The sales process theory indicates that you can usually reduce the reasons why you didn't get the sale or why your prospects weren't interested to six basic objections. By doing this the theory says you can start to formulate good responses to overcoming those six basic objections.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Within our industry the top objections are typically price and what we have labeled the kit objection which is I can get it at home centers for $49.95 so why should I pay $2 000 for a professional system? Good objections aren't they? But one of the six basic objections that is the most telling in our industry is the perceived need. How often do you hear potential customers tell you that a landscape lighting system is a luxury not a need?</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Do you perceive a need? When was the last time you approached a job site and informed your client that you could address these three basic concerns with landscape lighting? When is the last time you thought about why people need landscape lighting?</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Let's discuss the first major need for landscape lighting security concerns. If you don't think people are willing to pay for a certain degree of security start taking notice of the proliferation of companies that are servicing the home security market. Start noticing how many yard signs are in front of homes today warning possible intruders that the home is protected with a security system. If there are six homes on the street and only one is completely lit with landscape lighting which house is an intruder least likely to pursue? With landscape lighting the prowler sees the security sign from the street. Effectively constructing and designing a landscape lighting system that takes into account each concern beauty safety and security will be very effective in providing ample protection and security to your customers.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>If you still don't believe your customers don't have a need for the security lighting you can provide ask yourself how many of your customers have porch lights? How many would leave that on at night?</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>With a landscape lighting system your customers get not only security but the safety elements are addressed. Changes in the elevation low level shrubs or plant material that people may trip over all are potential safety concerns that need to be addressed for the homeowner and his guests. Changes in the steps the deck the driveway the entrance ways all of these potential safety hazards and more can be addressed with landscape lighting. And by building in the proper controls for your customer with their landscape lighting system safety concerns can be ""turned on"" with motion sensing devices timers and more to give your customer comfort knowing that his family and visitors are able to avoid accidents.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>As you can see landscape lighting systems may fulfill more actual client needs than many other offerings being made in our industry today. If you can effectively present to your clients how you can address some security and safety concerns with landscape lighting you're 90 percent on your way to a sale. That's because the easy part and by far the biggest added value of a landscape lighting system is the beauty aspect. Most of us focus first on beauty in landscape lighting and dramatically diminish the safety and security issues so much that we also begin to believe in the myth that landscape lighting is a luxury. You have to believe and with good reason that an effective landscape lighting system fulfills some basic overall needs that every client you have wants to be fulfilled.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Being able to effectively present this to your clients goes a long way toward overcoming the most often-stated objection to landscape lighting. Price. By showing your customer how your design and concepts will address safety and security concerns plus add beauty your customers will begin to see that you're not only installing a high-quality product but you're providing them with an understanding and knowledge that a lighting system will add value to their home.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Now let's talk about the selfish side. Nothing can help your referrals more than an effective landscape lighting system. It will not only expand the living space for your clients it will give them year-round access and enjoyment to their landscape investment. In Michigan where you only have abundant daytime light from late April to late September landscape lighting's role in keeping your customers satisfied is even more dramatic. Consider Joe Homeowner who just made a large investment in his landscape. When is he going to really get to enjoy it? A couple months out of the year at best if there isn't landscape lighting. For a fraction of the total cost of landscape installation landscape lighting will allow your customers to benefit from the safety and security aspects of landscape lighting and enjoy the beauty that you brought to them for an entire season.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>To overcome each of the basic six objections that are in every sales presentation first overcome your own misconceptions. There truly is a need for landscape lighting. It's not a luxury. It's something that will bring year after year of benefits to your clients. And itâ€™ll do wonders for your referrals.</p></div>

<p>Landscape lighting and outdoor audio installations are growing at a faster rate than even the traditional irrigation and hardscape categories so if you&rsquo;re thinking about adding an additional service to your lineup for next season these are two areas for serious consideration.</p>

<p>Overall landscape lighting is easy to install has a high customer satisfaction rate and is a great lead generator because it serves as a lighted advertisement for your work every night. Outdoor audio is another new and rapidly growing category that pairs well with lighting installation. There are substantial opportunities in each of these areas because of the low penetration rate. Fewer than 10% of all existing single family detached homes have landscape lighting and fewer than 2% have outdoor audio. It&rsquo;s worth noting the audio offering now available is far superior to the &ldquo;speaker rocks&rdquo; which may come to mind.</p>

<p>What do you need to know to get started?</p>

<ol style=""list-style-type:decimal"">
	<li><strong>Get Quality Installation Training.</strong> It&rsquo;s important to have some level of professional training. Lighting and outdoor audio installations are easy for pros but homeowners and novices find it challenging. Like irrigation installation both landscape lighting and outdoor audio systems are low voltage so the safety risks are less than with traditional voltage installations. However some markets do require a licensed electrician to finalize the installation but that isn&rsquo;t common and shouldn&rsquo;t deter you from entering the market. Investing time and energy in quality training upfront will pay off in terms of work quality and confidence.</li>
	<li><strong>Develop Brand and Product Expertise.</strong> Get comfortable with the brands and styles best suited for your local area and the type of work you&rsquo;re offering. SiteOne can connect you with top vendors and provide local expertise to help understand how to select the right product for the job.</li>
	<li><strong>Grow Local.</strong> Some consider lighting an art form where you paint your canvas with light. Being able to highlight the key attributes of someone&rsquo;s home is critical to the homeowner&rsquo;s satisfaction and subsequent referrals. Trees bushes gables columns pathways dormers and outdoor living spaces are all important focus areas of the palette to consider illuminating. SiteOne can help you develop a better understanding of this concept which will help you grow. Remember it&rsquo;s light to see not to see by.</li>
	<li><strong>Set Appropriate Spec and Pricing.</strong> As a contractor understanding what the homeowner wants is vital and will allow you to offer the right product at the right price. How you price your services will depend on a number of factors but landscape lighting has a healthy margin. Outdoor audio is also a rapidly growing new category with tremendous revenue and profit opportunities.</li>
</ol>

<p>SiteOne Landscape Supply can help at every stage of the process. Local and regional trainings on landscape lighting and outdoor audio installation are available through SiteOne University and your local SiteOne stores. Our representatives can even coordinate one-on-one training with top contractors who are interested in pursuing these services as an additional revenue stream.</p>

<p>In addition SiteOne offers a breadth of product from all of the top lighting manufacturers including the top colors and styles to meet your job-specific needs. Finally our expert staff members are here to assist you by answering questions and providing expert counsel on products and installation.</p>

<p>The past few years have seen a tidal wave of new electric handheld equipment from seemingly every power equipment manufacturer. Rest assured what&#39;s happening in this space is no fad and will soon change the game for many landscape contractors.</p>

<p>Across the country many cities counties homeowner and neighborhood associations are implementing local noise ordinances regulating the hours of operation for noisy gasoline-powered equipment. This move is simply the latest expression of a consumer desire to see the green industry become greener.</p>

<p>Most of the U.S. electricity supply is still generated by burning coal or natural gas so the debate about what&#39;s holistically cleaner is far from over. But for contractors the more troubling trend is the expansion of ethanol in gasoline &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; which wreaks havoc on small engines &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and shows no signs of slowing down.</p>

<p>As a landscape contractor if local regulations aren&#39;t pushing you toward electric handheld equipment then wear and tear from ethanol may cause you to at least consider it. In addition to expanded hours when quieter battery-powered equipment may be operated it also carries greatly reduced maintenance requirements compared to gas-powered units.</p>

<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when selecting battery-powered tools for your professional landscaping crews:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Consider running one system: Many companies offer systems where multiple handheld tools can operate on the same batteries. Purchasing tools from the same family creates efficiency in terms of parts extra batteries and ease of use.</li>
	<li>Know what power numbers matter: Remember that a battery&#39;s ampere capacity is much more important than volts. Ampere hour (Ah) is the measure of battery duration. Ah is in essence your gas tank; the larger your tank the longer a battery will operate. Below are standard battery sizes and associated Ah values.
	<p>Wh (watt hours) is the technical unit of measure for battery capacity. It&#39;s important to remember that 1 Wh does not always equate to one hour. Length of run will be affected by the tool load and other conditions. For professional contractors this is an important number because you want the most work from a single charge.</p>

	<p>As with many trends in the green industry the best advice will come at the local level. SiteOne experts at your local store can provide insight on current regulations and the best equipment selections for your area.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>82V 2.5AH = (20) 2.5AH Lithium Cells</li>
		<li>82V 4AH = (40) 2AH Lithium Cells</li>
		<li>82V 5AH = (40) 2.5AH Lithium Cells (Twice the capacity of the 2.5AH)
		<ul>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Choose the right tool categories: For many reasons electric string trimmers may not be the best investment but electric hedge trimmers leaf blowers pole saws and other ancillary tools can be just as effective as their gasoline counterparts. Make sure that the tools you choose to replace with electric equipment can deliver equivalent power to complete the job.</li>

<p>A true test for any business is to produce income when unpredictable conditions force lawn care professionals to diversify or change their planning in sometimes rather drastic ways. Lawn care professionals face some sort of environmental change each and every year either it's too wet or too dry or warm too early or a late frost comes unexpectedly.</p><p>Slight modifications are needed in timing of applications or types of products used but in most cases the changes don't interrupt the final goal or business plan. However environmental changes can be so severe that drastic changes are required. For example drought conditions in some parts of the United States are forcing lawn care and landscape professionals to make drastic if not business-saving decisions. New ways of generating income need to be found if the companies want to keep key employees or even just stay alive. The more the conditions worsen the more creative business owners become. Sometimes businesses must diversify into markets and/or arenas that they never thought of before.</p><p>With this in mind the following suggestions are offered to help lawn care professionals generate income during drought conditions.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Soil Testing</h3><p>Soil testing provides the turfgrass manager with a way to provide service to clients throughout the entire year. Results can be used later during product application assisting the operator in balancing the proper amounts of nitrogen phosphorous and potassium as well as lime and sulfur. We recommend that soil tests be done annually so that changes can be monitored over a number of years.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Application of Lime or Sulfur</h3><p>Based soil test results applications of lime may be needed to correct pH levels. Applications of pelletized dolomitic limestone during periods of drought will not cause injury to the turf. Please advise your customers that limestone particles may be carried to low lying areas if a large amount of rainfall occurs over a short period of time. CAUTION: Sulfur should NOT be applied during periods of drought or while the turfgrass is under stress conditions. Rates will be given on the soil test results form.</p></div>

<p>Turfgrasses are categorized as either cool season or warm season according to their optimum growth periods. Cool season grasses grow actively in the cool weather of spring and fall and somewhat slower in the heat of summer. Optimum growth temperatures range from 60-75º F. Warm season grasses grow vigorously in the summer months. The optimum growth temperature range for warm season grasses is 80-95º F. Warm season grasses will lose their color when soil temperatures fall below 50º F and will go dormant after the first frost in the fall. Full turf establishment for both cool season and warm season grasses will take two to four months.</p><p>The cool season grasses do best in the Cool Humid and Cool Arid Zones of the U.S. There are differences in cold hardiness of cool season grass species; bluegrasses fine fescues and bentgrasses are more tolerant of harsh winters than perennial ryegrass and tall fescues. Tall fescues have better heat tolerance than the other cool season species and are better for establishment in the southern regions as well as in the upper portion of the Warm Humid Zone. Planting cool season grasses in late summer or fall will offer better competition against weeds and summer diseases.</p></div>

<p>Most turfgrasses are resilient and will recover from drought conditions with minimal injury if proper management practices are implemented prior to and after the onset of stress. Turf needs proper amounts of moisture and nutrients to aid in the recovery process. Proper cultural practices will also aid in drought tolerance and recovery.</p><p>Cool season grasses perform best in temperatures between 60 degrees and 75 degrees Fahrenheit whereas warm season turf performs well at temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Low soil moisture and increased temperatures between the months of June and August are very stressful to cool season turf. Due to low soil moisture the first signs of dormancy will be a loss of color in the turf. The turf will take on a bluish-gray color and become very dry and brittle. Applying as little as one inch of water per week can help the turf to retain color. Turfgrass can usually survive 4-5 weeks of dormancy with minimal damage. Dormant grass will not recover if the rhizomes roots and crowns dehydrate.</p><p>Proper irrigation practices are critical during times of drought. It is important to water deeply and infrequently opposed to lightly and frequently. Watering deeply helps the water to penetrate the soil allowing more moisture availability and retention. Watering lightly and frequently keeps the moisture on the surface causing quicker evaporation and shallow root development. Water should be applied in the early morning hours (between 5am - 9am). Avoid irrigation in the afternoon due to rapid evaporation and heat build up. Also avoid irrigation in the evening due to the promotion of disease pressure. In times of water bans one half inch of water every one to two weeks may be enough to keep the crown rhizomes and roots hydrated.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Mowing</h3><p>Certain precautions should be made when mowing turf during drought conditions. Always be sure that mower blades are sharp to avoid tearing the turf. Turf mowed with dull mower blades will take on a brownish-gray cast soon after mowing because of moisture loss through the torn tip of the grass blades. Do not remove more than one third of the new growth in any one mowing. Removing too much top growth will cause a reduction in root mass and will not enable the plant to retain enough moisture. Alternate mowing patterns to avoid soil compaction caused by tire tracking. These practices will help control stress during drought conditions, but should be practiced the entire season.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Fertilization</h3><p>Proper fertilization will help the turf become more stress-resistant and allow the plant to recover more quickly from the stress. Providing the turf with adequate potassium prior to drought conditions will help make the plant more stress-, insect- and disease-resistant and enable quicker recovery in the fall. Using slow release nitrogen will help keep the plant growing during drought periods and help the turf maintain its color. Avoid quick release nitrogen before and during drought periods. This practice can flush top growth and can predispose the plant to injury much quicker due to an out of balance root to shoot ratio (root growth to top growth ratio). It is best to use a 1:1 ratio of nitrogen to potassium to improve stress tolerance within the plant.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Wetting Agents</h3><p>Hydrophobic (water repellent) soils are found in many areas where turfgrass is grown. The use of long-term residual wetting agents will help alleviate problems associated with localized dry spot from hydrophobic soils for up to an entire growing season. Long-term residual wetting agents, like LESCOFlo Ultra, work best when applied preventively prior to moisture stress. Shorter residual wetting agents, such as LESCOWet Plus, also help alleviate problem areas from localized dry spot, but may need to be applied on a more frequent schedule. It is critically important that both long- and short-term residual wetting agents be incorporated into the soil with irrigation for the products to become effective in the alleviation of localized dry spot conditions. Keep in mind that wetting agents do not assist in water retention.  They allow for more efficient use of the available water by reducing the surface tension and allowing water to penetrate the hydrophobic layer of soil.</p><p>These practices, combined with other cultural practices such as aerification for thatch reduction, will help turf during stressful conditions. Turf should be re-evaluated at the end of August and preparations made for overseeding or sodding areas that do not recover.</p></div>

;;Timing-Crabgrass-Treatment-ParagraphComponent;Article Turf Page14 Paragraph Component;;"<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Crabgrass can be one of the most difficult weeds to control. There are many factors involved when attempting to control crabgrass with pre-emergent herbicides. These include herbicide selection, application rates, soils, cultural practices, environmental factors, and most importantly, timing. In many cases, improper application timing is the leading cause of crabgrass breakthrough. Applied too late, crabgrass will germinate and begin growth before the herbicide is incorporated into the soil. Applications made too early will have a depleted residual before all weed seeds have germinated.</p><p>When it comes to application timing, there are a few theories that are typically followed. These theories have some relevancy, but with changing weather patterns a more precise determination may be necessary.</p><p>Pre-emergent timing is often based on ornamental plant activity, including forsythia and lilac. It is often recommended to apply pre-emergent herbicides when these plants begin to bloom. This theory can somewhat be accurate, but does the germination of crabgrass really correlate with these plants? Maybe not. A good example of this would be a short period of above normal temperatures. These temperatures may cause ornamental plants to bloom, but the soil temperatures may remain the same or increase only a little. Also, the ornamental plants could have certain stresses on them, which may delay the blooming period.</p><p>Another theory based on the thickness of the lawn may be used. This theory suggests a thin lawn should have herbicides applied a little early and thicker lawns should have herbicides a little later in regard to forsythia blooming. As we have all seen, crabgrass germinates and thrives just as well in thick, healthy turf as it does in weak, thin turf.</p><p>For these reasons, the most beneficial time to apply pre-emergent herbicides can be determined by monitoring soil temperatures. This is the method most universities rely on. By monitoring the soil temperature, turf mangers can accurately plan for crabgrass germination. By most indications, crabgrass will germinate when the soil temperatures reach 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit for at least three days.</p></div>

If pH drops below 6.0 and soils are more acidic elements like manganese and aluminum become more soluble and their excessive uptake can reach toxic levels causing plant stress and failure.</p><p>Conversely high pH or highly alkaline soils usually suffer from reduced nutrient and especially micronutrient lock-up (iron magnesium and calcium). They can have high concentrations of sodium resulting in poor soil structure. Water and essential nutrients don't easily penetrate poorly structured soils resulting in nutrient deficiencies and stunted plant growth. </p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Changing Soil pH</h3><p>Soil pH is typically lowered with sulfur and raised with lime. Pelletized lime is generally the preferred method of lime application over granular for raising pH as it is much easier to apply pellets break down with water are less dusty and pelletized lime changes the pH quicker than granular lime. Dolomitic or calcitic lime may be used depending on the soils need for magnesium or calcium.</p><p>In many Western states and certain pockets of the U.S. soil pH may be greater than 7.5 and may need to be lowered using sulfur. The amount of sulfur to be used should be based on the soil test as soil type as well as soils that contain high amounts of free calcium carbonate aka ""free lime"" will require greater amounts of sulfur to lower pH. </p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Proper Sampling</h3><p>Soil test results are only as good as the samples collected and sent to the lab for analysis. Improper sampling is the largest area for error in the soil testing process and can lead to test results that could recommend over- or under application of nutrients and amendments.</p><p>Make sure to collect a representative sample of each area being tested. 1-2 cups of soil are needed for proper testing and should be free of plant tissue thatch mulch or other surface debris. For areas up to 10 000 sq. ft. 10-12 individual cores should be randomly taken and combined to make one composite sample to be placed in a sample bag. For areas over 10 000 sq. ft. randomly take one extra core for each additional 1 000 sq. ft.</p><p>Separate samples should be collected from areas that differ in soil color soil texture and type of plants grown. Avoid areas that have recently been fertilized or amended. Turf should be sampled at a depth of 3"" below the thatch layer while trees shrubs and ornamentals should be sampled to a depth of 6-12"" with cores being taken from inside and just outside the drip line. </p></div>

<h3>Benefits of Soil Testing</h3><p>Soil testing is an agronomic Best Management Practice (BMP) recommended by the fertilizer industry university agronomists and independent consultants that provides many benefits to the turf/landscape manager including:</p><ul><li>Monitors pH and nutrient levels in turf and landscape soils</li><li>Offers corrective action to optimize nutrient uptake (reduce lost fertilizer from nutrient lock-up)</li><li>Aids in customization of fertility programs</li><li>Promotes good industry stewardship</li><li>Allows you to grow a healthy and flourishing landscape to put your stamp on</li></ul></div>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Spring flowering bulbs provide vibrant colors in the early spring when hardly any other plants are blooming. Spring flowering bulbs must be planted in the fall to develop a good root system and to satisfy the bulb&rsquo;s cold requirement for blooming. In general, it&rsquo;s best to plant when the soil temperature is below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, but before the first frost. Use the following tips from our nursery experts to ensure your bulbs have the best chance at an impressive spring.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>BULB SELECTION: </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Bulbs should be firm, not mushy or soft, that signals a dead or bad bulb. Occasionally mold may form on the outer skin but can easily be brushed off and causes no harm to the bulb.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Tulips, unlike other fall planting bulbs, are not native to American gardens, and will not return the following year. Customers who deal with deer and rabbits can use deer resistant varieties like scilla, daffodils, and allium to help curb destruction in their garden.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
</ul>
</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>HOW TO PLANT BULBS: </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Good soil preparation is the key to planting bulbs. Generally, larger bulbs are planted about 8&rdquo; deep, and 5&rdquo; deep for the smaller varieties.&nbsp; The rule of thumb is that the depth of the bulb should be 3X the diameter. Bulbs prefer good draining soil, and do not like wet feet, so areas that collect heavy water are not ideal.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Place large bulbs with the nose facing upwards in the planting hole. Small bulbs can be scattered. The distance between the bulbs depends on the visual effect you are looking for.&nbsp; If using containers, bulbs may be planted in layers based on size. Always place the bulb with the pointed side up, cover with soil, water, and let the winter rains and snow take care of watering until spring. Plant bulbs in clumps, or stagger to create larger washes of color. Paying attention to bloom times when planting can help fill in spent blooms in the garden and create a show of color that lasts all spring.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Planters and Pots: </strong>Plant bulbs in layers to prolong the flowering period. Bulbs that flower early can be planted on top of the later flowering bulbs.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Lawns and Grass Strips: </strong>Daffodils, Crocus, and Scilla Siberica are very suitable for planting under grass. The earliest flowering bulb types are the best choice.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Mass Plantings in Beds and Borders: </strong>Add spring flowering bulbs to perennial and rose borders for a burst of color in early spring.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Naturalizing Bulbs: </strong>Daffodils, Crocus, Muscari, Scilla, and most other small bulbs are perennial and can be left in the soil to return for many years.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>KNOW YOUR HARDINESS ZONE: </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Proper knowledge of the zone where bulbs are to be planted will help minimize failures when spring arrives. Familiarize your customers with the zones their properties occupy and read bulb labels to help ensure you&rsquo;re planting at the right time.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Within colder regions (zones 1 through 4 or a mountainous region) use additional mulch to protect against severe freezing temperatures (20 degrees below zero).&nbsp; Remember, however, heavy mulching will need to be removed in spring to ensure the flower can bloom properly.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><br />
<strong>BULB STORAGE: </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Bulbs need to be kept in a cool and dry location with good circulation and low humidity prior to planting. The warmer temperatures and healthy rains in spring activate bulbs, so storing in areas that have higher moisture and heat will trigger a bulb to grow. Bulbs with sprouts can still be planted, but the sprout should not be removed, or the plant will not grow.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><br />
<strong>AFTER-CARE: </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">After a bulb has bloomed and faded, do not cut down the leaves and stalk. Let the plant die back naturally and brown out over the course of late spring and early summer.&nbsp; Once brown, remove the spent leaves. Some bulbs, after time, will need to be dug up and divided, to ensure continued flowering.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Bulbs are an excellent choice for public gardens, parks, golf courses, municipalities, and any landscape design. SiteOne&nbsp; offers a selection of the strongest varieties and top size bulbs; ask an associate for details about the available varieties and our bulk and seasonal pricing programs.</p></div>

<p>As a professional landscape contractor your reputation depends not only on the work your crew does but also the appearance of your customers’ landscape throughout the year.  Selecting year round interest plants emphasizes the beauty of your landscape design as well as reinforcing the value of your services to customers when surrounding yards are dormant. </p><p>The main characteristics of good transitional plantings are those that are <strong>early indicators</strong> (blooming early in the spring) those with <strong>interesting defoliation patterns</strong> or peeling bark and those that maintain a <strong>verdant appearance year round</strong>.  Below are our top picks for early spring species that exemplify these traits: </p><p><strong>Forsythia</strong>- Marked by golden yellow blooms Forsythia is one of the earliest seasonal indicators.  In fact some landscape contractors even use the blooming of forsythia as a reminder to begin applying pre-emergent herbicide to their customers’ turf and ornamental beds.  Another benefit to specifying this plant is its affordability. </p><p><strong>Crocus</strong>- This plant starts as a bulb that’s planted in the fall before the first frost of the year.  It requires long periods of coolness and dark to activate so it performs best in areas that have a distinct shift from winter to spring weather patterns.  It blooms low to the ground and displays best in clusters. </p><p><strong>Daffodils</strong>- Another flower that starts as a bulb daffodils are another early indicator like forsythia.  Remember to plant these bulbs with the pointed ends up.  Popular early-blooming color varieties include Dutch Master and February Gold. </p><p><strong>Boxwood- </strong>This long-time favorite shrub remains a nice looking plant throughout the year in a majority of the country.  The Solid Evergreen variety tends to do well in most hardiness zones and provides some good texture and a leafy backdrop for the early blooming flowers included in this list.</p><p><strong>Flowering cherries</strong>- Flowering cherry trees come in a variety of colors and contrast nicely in texture with the dormant leaves of other plants early in the season.  This tree usually does well in the southeast up through the northern region of the US.  </p><p>It’s important to remember that your specific jobsite location will play a major role in what spring planting(s) will perform best.  This list is designed as a basic guide; however factors like sun exposure USDA zones the need for pest resistant plants or specific watering requirements will also impact the recommended plant types.  </p><p><a href=""/en/nurserydirect"">SiteOne’s Nursery Direct Program</a> offers direct nationwide shipment of quality plant products directly to your jobsite even if you don’t have a nursery near you.

<p>Nearly ten years later, The Great Recession is still impacting the U.S. nursery and plant industry. In late 2008 as home equity values became more uncertain and consumer spending dwindled, many plant growers pulled back on production.</p>

<p>The national economic rebound, coupled with substantial growth in the outdoor living market, has driven demand for certain plant varieties. Growers who cut back production during the recession are still struggling to keep up with the surge. At the same time, growers who supplied the liner stock of young trees also cut back on production, causing a ripple effect that is impacting production cycles.</p>

<p>This is especially true for plants such as large caliper trees, which have a much longer growth cycle. Demand is so high for two-inch caliper Live Oak and Red Maple trees that growers are selling trees that were supposed to be held for development into three and four-inch caliper sizes. This places even more strain on the future supply of large caliper trees.</p>

<p>The supply of these trees is so tight that contractors who want large orders of Live Oaks&nbsp;(a staple for large commercial projects or residential developments)&nbsp;are likely to encounter challenges securing their full order. And contractors who typically buy plants from the yard the day of a project may not find the trees they want in-stock.</p>

<p>Luckily, with some planning and strategy, contractors can still get the plants they need.</p>

<p>Re-wholesalers, such as SiteOne, can leverage their unique market position to increase the likelihood that an order can be filled, but it takes some planning on the part of the contractor. To increase their chances of success, contractors should:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Order Early.</strong> If contractors can project demand for the upcoming planting season, SiteOne associates can start working to increase the likelihood of filling a full order for short-supply plants.</li>
	<li><strong>Know What to Ask For.</strong> Plants that have a relatively short growing cycle, such as container shrubs, will be in abundant supply when the time comes. However, for larger trees, contractors should communicate their needs as soon as possible to their suppliers.</li>
	<li><strong>Tell Your Friends (And Enemies).</strong> Distributors make projections based on internal sales numbers, but that&#39;s sales data, not demand data. To help ensure accurate projections, suppliers need to hear from multiple contractors in every region. If suppliers have more demand data about a region, they can better balance their projections and recommendations to growers. When suppliers can make projections based on demand, it means contractors are less likely to be caught in the supply squeeze.</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes down to the bottom line, the benefits of working with a large re-wholesaler are clear:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>National Reach + Regional Expertise:</strong> SiteOne purchases plants from more than 1,000 growers nationwide, but the actual plant buying happens on a regional level. With full-time field buyers working across five regions, SiteOne has deep local knowledge on demand, quality and availability.</li>
	<li><strong>Smart Forecasting:</strong> Because SiteOne possesses unique, detailed nation-wide knowledge on market conditions, our teams can make far more accurate projections for plant needs. This allows SiteOne to confidently enter into growing agreements with growers to secure the right products. Some current grower contracts extend into 2021.</li>
	<li><strong>Product Shifting:</strong> On occasion, unexpected weather conditions can quickly alter regional demand for certain plants. SiteOne&#39;s national network allows us to quickly move product to the areas of the most demand or need, providing a more relevant selection to our customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>As growers and suppliers work to meet the high demand for some plants, SiteOne is uniquely positioned to deliver the benefits of national reach to local markets. Given advance notice from contractors, SiteOne can increase the likelihood that challenging orders can be filled.</p>

Encourage customers to continue their routine landscape maintenance schedule throughout the fall to reduce the build-up of debris.</p><ul>	<li>Offer add-on preventive protection services to clients. These services can include cleaning and storing patio furniture for homeowners	 repairing cracked concrete (pavers or slabs) so that water freeze-thaw cycle doesn&rsquo;t make the crack worse	 addressing soil compaction leading to sunken pavers (uneven surfaces can hinder snow and ice removal)	 and pressure washing.<br /></li><li>Add more sand between the joints of brick or concrete paver surfaces. This will reduce shifting	 help hold the pavers in place	 and allow for proper drainage after snow melt or rain.<br /></li><li>Choose ice-melt wisely. Some chemicals in deicers can cause damage to pavers and plants. Try using calcium-based ice melts. Calcium-based ice melts tend to have fewer negative side effects compared to some of the blends with more chemicals in them.<br /></li><li>Check for existing drainage issues. If pools of water sit in driveways and sidewalks after summer rains	 then these areas will likely cause even more trouble in icy conditions.<br /></li><li>Stock up on the winter snow and ice removal tools like snow plows	 snow shovels	 and snow pushers before the season begins. Don&rsquo;t wait for a weather event or you could be out of tools (and luck) when your customers need you. Distributors	 including SiteOne	 have Early Order Programs available for these specialty items that allow you to stock up and save by purchasing in bulk ahead of the seasonal demand.</li></ul></div>

Hardscape projects like paver patios	 segmented retaining walls	 water features	 fire pits	 walk ways	 driveways	 and built-in kitchens provide tools for commercial and residential customers to maximize every square foot of their living/working space. What has changed are the trends and tools available to hardscapes contractors. Below is our recap of hardscapes industry trends from the last Hardscapes North America Show:</p><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>Hardscapes Industry Trends:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Virtual reality (VR) visualization tools</strong>- VR has been an emerging technology for design	 architecture	 and real estate businesses for the last few years. Now that the costs of the technologies have come down suppliers are integrating VR tools into their landscape project planning services. Viewing 3D renderings in VR through tools like the Belgard Design Studio leads to happier clients and increased closure rates for contractors because customers can see the finished project before the first paver is physically laid; this helps minimize the sometimes gray area of translating design from 2D to reality. <br /></li><li><strong>Permeable pavers</strong>- Unique designs by suppliers like Belgard and their Aqualine Series <a href=""/en/hardscapes-outdoor-living-stones-pavers-edging/c/sh1514"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">Permeable Paver</a> help manage runoff by allowing storm water to pass through the material and directly absorb into the ground or be gathered and recycled for irrigation. Contractors can expect to see supplier offerings expand as more and more consumers become interested in hardscaping materials that can help with water capture	 storage and reuse.<br /></li><li><strong>New paver textures and </strong><strong>shapes</strong>- Gone are the days of only rectangular pavers. The myriad of hardscapes vendors at this year’s HNA show indicated consumers’ demand for eclectic paver design and texture options.  Whether it’s the feel of cobble stone or <a href=""https://www.turfmagazine.com/hardscapes/creative-artistic-paver-installations/"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">eye-catching laying patterns</a>	 paver design options are showing up everywhere and only limited by the designer’s imagination and project budget. <br /></li><li><strong>Ancillary systems</strong>-  As components like water features and outdoor seating areas remain popular	 ancillary systems like outdoor audio and<a href=""/en/lighting/c/sh11"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline""> landscape lighting</a> continue to expand. In the spirt of making tools more efficient	 contractors can also expect to see advancements in smart lighting and controls to help save customers time and money over the life of these systems. </li></ul><p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Labor concerns and lack of knowledge can sometimes hamper contractors from adding hardscapes to their services lineup; however	 manufacturers are continually improving material options to reduce the expertise	 labor	 and time required to successfully complete hardscapes projects.

<p>Market growth in the outdoor living space has been phenomenal over the past few years, but the green industry has also been faced with labor shortages. One way to capitalize on the growth of this sector, while keeping labor challenges in mind, is for landscape and irrigation contractors to offer hardscaping as an additional service and look for opportunities to do more at every jobsite. For example, just about every hardscape installation requires some form of drainage solution.</p>

<p>During the past year, many stories have surfaced regarding the lack of labor in landscaping markets. Some contractors reported turning away hundreds of thousands of dollars in new business because they didn&#39;t have the crews and/or couldn&#39;t find local labor to hire.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the labor shortage is happening at the same time as substantial growth in the industry. According to the Freedonia Group</p>

<p>, the landscape products market in the U.S. is estimated to grow 5.3% annually through 2019 to an estimated $8.2 billion. Much of this anticipated growth will be driven by residential homeowners upping the curb appeal of their homes, and for many homes across the country, this translates to consideration of a hardscape project.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that a business opportunity exists, but how can contractors take advantage of it without hiring new personnel and without highly skilled labor?</p>

<p>Newer products on the market, like Satura from Belgard</p>

<p>are changing the dynamics of the hardscape labor force and market. By offering manufactured stone products, these companies make hardscapes easier to install, meaning less crew training is required while providing many of the natural stone looks that clients desire at a lower price point. Depending on a number of factors, manufactured stone is typically half to one-third the price of natural stone. This translates to a business opportunity for landscape contractors to train their existing crew to install manufactured hardscape products and offer this service to their existing customer base. Other labor-saving products, like Alliance Gator Base or super sacks to transport aggregates, can also help reduce labor demands.</p>

<p>Where to begin with hardscapes:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Knowledge.</strong> While installation is a relatively simple process, it&#39;s still important to get professional training either from the manufacturer or your supplier.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as much as <strong>50%</strong> of the water used for outdoor irrigation is wasted due to inefficient watering methods and systems. Statistics like these along with stricter local watering regulations and increased demands on water supply reiterate the importance of understanding your irrigation options especially when it comes to spray heads.</p>
<p>Updated spray head offerings typically include high efficiency features such as pressure regulators flow restriction devices and check valves. Read on for a description of these important components and the benefits for customers who elect new systems to make their existing irrigation systems more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Pressure Regulators</strong></p>
<p>Pressure regulators are helpful on sites with high water pressure or those on a downward slope. These components typically reduce water pressure to 30psi which can result in as much as a 30% water savings.</p>
<p><strong>Flow Restriction Devices</strong></p>
<p>Found inside of high efficiency spray heads these devices reduce the flow rate to the riser or completely shut off the water if a nozzle is broken or missing. Some flow restriction devices even have the ability to generate a tall indicator stream if a nozzle is compromised increasing the chance of a timely repair and reducing the amount of water leaked.</p>
<p><strong>Check Valves:</strong></p>
<p>Similar to pressure regulators check valves&nbsp;are useful on sloped sites or those prone to draining out. In areas of elevation change these devices keep water flowing the way the system design intended. Depending on the degree of slope check valves can produce as much as 20 gallons of water savings per minute.</p>

<p>Meeting plant material water requirements with irrigation systems can be a challenging task under normal circumstances. When slope plantings are involved applying water efficiently and effectively can be extremely challenging. Too little water and nothing will grow too much water and you've got erosion problems. If this sounds familiar read on.</p><p>From controller programming to selecting the correct <a href=""/en/irrigation-sprinklers/c/sh1428"">sprinkler</a> several tactics can be utilized to help you deal with the ups and downs of slope irrigation.</p><p><strong>Tip #1</strong><br />Look for controllers that can limit run times and have multiple start times.<br /><br />Choose an <a href=""/en/irrigation-controllers/c/sh1414"">irrigation controller</a> that will allow you to apply several applications of water during a watering cycle. Do not exceed the infiltration rate of the soil. Applying too much water on a flat areas will cause puddles. When too much water is applied to a slope erosion will occur.</p><p>Select an advanced controller with a feature like Cycle+Soak™. This will easily allow the total irrigation run time to be split into usable cycles thereby minimizing runoff.</p><p><strong>Tip #2</strong><br />Space lateral lines across the slope rather than with the slope.<br /><br />When installing the lateral lines make sure they follow the contours of the slope. If lateral lines are incorrectly installed from the top to the bottom of a slope the pressure differential by the elevation change will create severely uneven pressures at the sprinkler nozzles. This will cause irregular water distribution. Additionally the higher pressures could damage pipes and sprinklers.</p><p><strong>Tip #3</strong><br />As an insurance policy use a master valve and flow sensing equipment.</p> <p>It's very important to use a master valve when irrigating slopes. Locate the master valve as close to the point of connection as possible and before the zone valves. A master valve only turns on when the system is running. A master valve prevents the mainline from being pressurized unless the irrigation controller initiates an irrigation cycle.</p><p>Flow sensing equipment can detect excessively high flows which are usually created if a pipe breaks or a sprinkler is damaged. If a pipe or sprinkler failure occurs this will minimize damage to the slope.</p></div>

;;Backflow-Preventers-ParagraphComponent;Article Irrigation Page4 Paragraph Component;;"<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Backflow preventers are saving lives across the United States. Sound dramatic? It's really not when you think about the potential danger of consuming water not suitable for drinking. Many states now require the installation of a backflow preventer on every sprinkler irrigation system. A properly installed backflow preventer protects a home's pure drinking water supply by stopping contaminated water from mixing with the drinking water. Understanding what backflow is how it occurs and how to stop potentially dangerous backflow situations will help to avoid problems in your clients' drinking water.</p> <p><strong>What is Backflow and how does it occur?</strong></p><p>When nonpotable water or other substances flow through a cross-connection and into the piping of a public water system or consumer's potable water system it is called backflow. Backflow can be caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the supply pressure or by negative pressure (a vacuum). Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps temperature increases in boilers etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied such as during water line flushing fire fighting or breaks in water mains. Backsiphonage (a vacuum) can occur when there is a stoppage of water supply due to nearby fire fighting a break in a water main etc.</p><p><strong>How can I stop potentially dangerous backflow situations or avoid them all together?</strong></p><p>Irrigation systems make watering lawns and gardens easier and save time BUT water that may be contaminated by weed killers and/or fertilizers can backflow into the home's drinking water. Irrigation systems not protected by approved backflow prevention assemblies could endanger the health of a household neighborhood or community. Steps can be taken to prevent this dangerous situation.</p><p>First ensure that a proper backflow preventer is installed and maintained. A backflow preventer is a mechanism to prevent backflow which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly the pressure vacuum breaker assembly and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p><p>All irrigation systems new or existing should be equipped with an approved backflow prevention assembly. Only properly installed state-approved backflow prevention assemblies meet the plumbing code and provide health protection for family and neighbors.</p></div>

<p>&quot;My profits are getting smaller.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s getting harder to compete with XYZ competitor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My competition is too cheap.&quot;</p>

<p>We hear these complaints all the time. Well here is a way to separate yourself from the competition and save the homeowner money. How? By charging more. Yes by charging more.</p>

<p>Now before you say we&#39;re crazy let us explain. How can you charge more money and still save the homeowner money? By installing better products that save the homeowner money in the long run.</p>

<h3>Better Products Use Less Water</h3>

<p>You can easily save your customer 15 gallons of water per sprinkler per week. And this is a conservative number. 15 gallons per sprinkler per week means a great deal of water conservation and puts money back in the pocket of the homeowner. Today most customers will jump at the chance to save 15 gallons of water. Also most cities charge for water usage and water disposal or sewer. Thus the customer can save twice as much money (once on the use and once on the sewer). And the best part is you can confidently charge your customers more for these efficient smart improvements.</p>

<p>One product that can help customers save this much water: pressure regulating spray heads. By reducing the pressure from 40 PSI to 30 PSI on a 15&#39; radius half-pattern spray head with an average run time of 60 minutes per week pressure regulating spray heads will easily save 15 gallons per week per sprinkler. Remember this is based upon reducing the pressure only by 10 PSI. And this a conservative number &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; imagine the savings with a 20 or 30 PSI reduction.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s work through a typical small residential installation. Suppose you are bidding a job that will have 10 spray heads. Each product will be a 15&#39; radius half pattern spray head. Each will run 1 hour a week. This will be a savings of 15 gallons per sprinkler times 10 sprinklers which equals 150 gallons of water per week. Now multiply this by how many weeks a year you irrigate.</p>

<p>If you want to work out different scenarios please visit <a href=""https://www.rainbird.com/professionals/calculators"" target=""_blank"">Rain Bird&#39;s water savings calculators</a>.</p>

<p>Installing pressure-regulating spray heads is one of the simplest ways to save your homeowner customers money. It takes no additional labor to install and it sells itself to the customer. Imagine telling the homeowner &quot;You will save 15 gallons per week per sprinkler compared to my competitor&#39;s bid of using traditional non-pressure regulating spray heads.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a win-win situation for everyone.</p>

;;Institutional-Irrigation-Systems-ParagraphComponent;Article Irrigation Page6 Paragraph Component;;"<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Design</h3><p>As with the layout of the field itself proper design of the institutional irrigation system is a critical step; a poorly planned system cannot be made to work properly by remedial steps later. The system design should be driven by player and user safety as well as the need for dependability efficiency and easy maintenance.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>It may be tempting to employ the services of a volunteer designer for an irrigation project. But an experienced institutional or sports field irrigation design professional or consultant will usually allow the turf manager to save both time and money in the long run. Designing an effective system requires knowledge of pipe hydraulics zoning techniques head spacing wire sizing and the efficiency features and reliability of various rotary sprinklers valves and controllers. The cost to repair a single error in any of these areas can easily be higher than the fee charged by an experienced designer.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>In planning a system the designer will give a great deal of consideration to choosing the most appropriate equipment since each sports field project has its own specific product and budget requirements. Placement of the heads and valves will also be a major consideration and the designer will space the heads so they are not in heavy traffic areas and the valves are well off the field of play.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Pipe</h3><p>The pipe running from the irrigation system's point of connection (POC) into the service line to the zone control valves is called the ""continuous pressure main line"" or simply ""main line"". It is a common practice to use solvent welded PVC pipe at a depth of 18 inches below the surface for pipe sizes up to 4 inches and 24 inches below the surface for pipes larger than 4 inches. Gasketed pipe is sometimes specified and should be placed deeper; 36 inches under the surface for pipes larger than 4 inches is usually considered reasonable. However higher system pressures may lead the designer to specify deeper installation to hold the pipe securely in place.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>The non-pressure pipes which connect the control valves to the sprinkler heads are referred to as ""lateral lines."" These lines can be installed at a depth of 12 inches which is standard for the industry.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>The backfill surrounding the pipe should be rock-free and compacted to the same degree as the neighboring soil. The rock-free backfill will help prevent pipe breakage and the consistent compaction will prevent ruts in the turf that are caused by the uneven settling of the soil over the pipe trench.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Poured-in-place concrete ""thrust blocks"" are sometimes specified where pipe connections must be especially solid. For instance thrust blocks are typically specified at all changes in direction on all gasketed pipe for main line pipes over 2"" in diameter and on long runs when the system will have higher-than-normal pressure.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Specifying the proper pipe sizes helps maintain the correct water velocity and minimizes friction losses throughout the system. Water flowing through pipes experiences considerable drag or friction from the pipe itself; when the velocity of the water increases the pressure loss from friction increases. If the pipe used for the system is too small the operating pressure will be much lower for the heads at the end of the zone than for the heads closest to the valve serving that zone. Irrigation designers agree that there should be no more than a 10% variation in pressure among all heads on a zone.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Most institutional and sports field irrigation system designs show a looped main line. Designers also like to maintain about the same pressure from one zone to another. The reduced pressure loss experienced when the water is flowing from two directions in a looped main line helps them achieve a relatively balanced pressure throughout the main line at a reduced cost. The designer would have to size the pipe larger with a single connection main line than is necessary with the looped system. This smaller pipe size saves money while reducing the pressure loss to the furthest valve.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>PVC pipe is also used as sleeves for the irrigation system's pipes and wires where they pass under walkways driveways and roads. A good rule of thumb for sleeve sizing is two times the size of the pipe being sleeved.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Sprinklers Nozzles and Swing Joints</h3><p>The sprinkler head consists of three major components: the main body of the device the nozzles through which water flows out of the body and the swing joint at the bottom of the body which maintains the sprinkler's connection to the lateral lines.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Sprinkler heads have been gradually downsized over the years primarily for safety purposes. Newer heads have a small surface diameter and a protective thick rubber cover which makes them a very safe alternative to the older-style sprinklers.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Additionally many of the newer heads have a strong spring for positive retraction so the head will not endanger the public by staying in the up position after the watering is completed. Many of today's safer heads also have a heavy-duty body cap to stand up to the large equipment now being used in routine maintenance. Most gear-driven rotary sprinkler heads should be installed right at the finish grade of the turf.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Designers also prefer a rotary sprinkler with a large nozzle selection. The nozzle is chosen to fine-tune the flow of water out of the system. The experienced irrigation system designer will use correct nozzle sizes to obtain matched precipitation (the precipitation rate for sprinkler systems is the rate expressed in inches per hour at which water is applied over the surface of the turf). Matched precipitation means the entire field is receiving about the same amount of water.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Swing joints can be fabricated on-site by the installers of the system or can be manufactured parts provided by the supplier. A three-elbow double swing joint will perform efficiently if fabricated correctly. Manufactured double swing joints with o-ring seals cut down on installation time and are often more dependable. Correctly installed a double-swing joint provides flexibility and resists breakage when large mowers or other heavy equipment rolls over the sprinkler.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Valves</h3><p>In an irrigation system there are two basic types of valves: shut-off valves and sprinkler valves. Shut-off valves (""gate valves"" or ""ball valves"") are used in a continuous pressure main line to temporarily turn the water off to the entire system or a section of the system. Sprinkler valves (manual or automatic) are used to deliver the water from the continuous pressure main line to the sprinklers. In the discussion of sprinkler systems when the term valve is used alone it usually refers to an automatic control valve.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Gate valves have a wheel type handle and several turns of the handle are required to turn off the flow of water. Gate valves are most commonly used on main line pipes with high water pressure or high water flow. Because several turns are required they are easier to turn off and the potential for damage caused by water hammer is reduced. Gate valves have a brass-to-brass seat which means that they may eventually lose their secure seal. For this reason gate valves are not recommended for frequent use.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Ball valves have a single arm or lever that requires one-quarter turn to turn on or off. This single action is convenient but caution should be used and the valve should not be turned on or off too quickly because damage to the system from water hammer could result. Ball valves have resilient seats which maintain their ability to seal longer than brass-to-brass seats making ball valves a better choice than gate valves where frequent use is expected.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Among sprinkler valves manual control valves are not as common as they once were. The manually controlled sprinkler system requires an operator to time the irrigation of each zone and to turn valves on and off at the proper time. The operator must be present the entire time the system is operating. Obviously this type of system does not have the convenience of the automatic system.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Automatic control valves are used in conjunction with automatic controllers or timers and are a much more convenient way to deliver water to the turf. Because these valves can be more precisely controlled an automatic system allows the sports turf manager to efficiently schedule the delivery of the right amount of water to each zone.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>There are many types of automatic control valves. On systems not connected directly to city water systems choose a valve with an inexpensive self cleaning filtering mechanism. Because of the possibility of higher surge pressure in a large turf system it is recommended that the valve be able to withstand pressures up to 200 PSI. A pressure regulator can be installed at the beginning of the system but with the long main line and the potential for high friction loss it is generally better to have an automatic control valve with a built-in pressure regulator and control the pressure right at the valve.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Placement of the valves should be planned with maintenance and safety in mind. Automatic control valves are generally installed in groups or manifolds and placed underground in a plastic or concrete valve box. If the valves will be near the field of play use plastic. The manifolds should be built with plenty of room between valves. The distance between valves is dependent on the size of the valve box; for most standard size boxes two or three 1"" valves can be installed in a valve box while valves larger than 1"" are usually installed one valve per box.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Controllers</h3><p>The controller (or ""timer"") is the part of an automatic sprinkler system that determines when a valve will turn on and how long the valve will operate. The controller sends a low voltage signal through buried wires to the automatic control valve which then opens for a predetermined amount of time allowing water to flow to the sprinklers. When the predetermined watering time is completed the controller turns off the valve.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>A controller should be chosen for its wide range of programming capabilities as well as other convenience features. A non-volatile memory means the controller will not lose the program due to power outages or surges. Surge protection will protect the controller from serious damage due to nearby lightning strikes or power surges.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Controllers should be placed in an easily accessible location in a lockable room or waterproof enclosure. In considering the controller it is important to remember that some systems require a pump to maintain adequate water pressure. Be sure the controller chosen for this type of system includes a pump start feature. If a pump is needed the two pieces of equipment are typically placed in the same enclosure. However the controller should use a separate electrical circuit to reduce the possibility of damage to the controller due to power surges.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>As with any electrical equipment to prevent injury from high voltage electrical shock it is essential to specify that a proper ground wire be installed to the controller. Consult local codes for the grounding requirements in a specific area.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Wires</h3><p>In an automatic sprinkler system low voltage direct burial wire is used to carry the signal from the controller to the automatic control valves. The most frequently used wire for commercial applications is single strand heavy gauge direct burial copper wire. A lighter gauge wire can be used when installing valves close to the controller but heavier gauge wire is necessary for longer distances and may be necessary even for short distances on higher pressure systems. An irrigation designer or consultant will specify the necessary wire size when designing the system.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Many specifiers recommend that the wire be buried in the same trench as the main line taped to the under side of the pipe. This will help to protect the wire and make it easier to locate. Furthermore a wire taped to the pipe can serve as a tracer wire to locate the main line should it become necessary to do so.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Wherever control wire will be exposed it should be installed in a protective conduit. Waterproof wire connectors should be used to connect the solenoid wires to the low voltage irrigation wire. Where permitted by local code wire nuts can be used for connections not exposed to moisture.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Backflow Prevention</h3><p>In order to protect the potable (drinking) water supply from contamination most states and municipalities require the installation of backflow prevention devices on all plumbing systems that are connected to the public water supply. These devices prevent water from the system from flowing backward into the supply lines. In planning or installing an institutional or sports field irrigation system the designer should consult with the local water company to determine the backflow devices required and their proper installation.</p></div>

;;Reading-A-Pump-Curve-ParagraphComponent;Article Irrigation Page8 Paragraph Component;;"<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Have you ever wondered how to read a pump curve or even what a pump curve is? The pump curve will tell you the performance of the pump prior to installing it. This is very helpful because there is no guessing involved on whether or not the pump will meet your needs.</p>

<p>First we want to know the gallons per minute (gpm) and the psi needed to operate the sprinkler system. For this example let&#39;s assume we need 30 gpm at 55 psi.</p>

<p>Secondly with an irrigation pump the manufacturer typically rates the pump in Head not psi so we must convert our 55 psi to Head. In order to do this we take 55 psi and multiply it by 2.31 which equals 127 Head or is sometimes referred to as 127 Total Dynamic Head (TDH).</p>

<p>Now we can look at the pump curve to size our pump for 30 gpm @ 127 TDH.</p>

<p><a href=""/medias/sys_master/root/hee/h57/8942833893406/pump-curve-chart.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Download PDF of Chart</a></p>

<p>You may notice by looking at the graph that the bottom is labeled gpm and the left side is labeled TDH. We pick the gpm and Head we need to operate the system. We follow these two lines up until they meet usually somewhere in the center of the graph. At this point we draw a dot. This is the place where we want our pump to perform at.</p>

<p>Now we look at the curve in the middle of the graph. This curve usually starts in the upper left hand corner and ends on the lower right hand corner. This curve represents what the pump will perform at. Hopefully our dot is on the curve or just below the curve indicating that our pump will meet our needs. If the dot is above the curve we must select another pump.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it. Now a few items to make note of:</p>

<ol style=""list-style-type:decimal"">
	<li>Make sure your dot is always on the curve or under the curve.</li>
	<li>Make sure your dot is generally on the left side or center of the curve. Never choose a point on the far right side of the curve. If you&#39;re on the far right side choose another pump.</li>
	<li>You may have noticed that there is a direct relationship between gpm and Head. The more gpm you want the less Head the pump delivers. Always size your pump for gpm 1st and Head 2nd.</li>

Each year when the leaves start to fall and temperatures drop we know it's time to shut down irrigation systems. In the colder climates irrigation systems must be winterized to avoid damage caused by freezing temperatures. By taking the necessary steps to protect irrigation systems now you can avoid costly repairs in the spring.</p><p>First there are some claims of irrigation systems being self-draining. This might be true however is it worth the gamble? Drains can get clogged or forgotten to be opened or water can be trapped in low spots. For the added safety and fairly low cost of winterizing with an air compressor it's not worth the gamble. Blowing out an irrigation system with an air compressor has been proven to be the best method in use today.</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
The following is the procedure for winterizing a typical irrigation system. Throughout the country the products and scenarios may differ but generally the sequence of procedures remains the same.</p><p>First and foremost turn off the water! There will always be a master shut off valve somewhere. The basement crawl space or utility room would be the first place to check. Turn it off and tag it for future reference. Placing a tag on the valve indicating it's for the irrigation system will prevent any mishaps that could happen for an unknowing homeowner.</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
Next manually drain the system (as much as possible). This will alleviate the pressure in the system and give you a head start on the winterizing process. Usually opening a hose bib or drain on the backflow preventer will do nicely. Sometimes there is a drain inside the house. Don't forget to use a bucket to catch any drained water. Warning you might get wet. Opening a drain under pressure will shoot water out for the first few seconds until the pressure locked in the system dies down.</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
Once the pressure has been bled from the system and the water has drained down a little it's time to hook up the compressor.</p><p>The compressor size being used should depend on the system size. Usually bigger is better (and faster). A smaller compressor can work but it might take a while. Recommended compressors should deliver a minimum of 60 psi at 15 cubic feet per minute (CFM). This is what actually displaces the water. Most compressors will not have a problem delivering the psi but it's the CFM's where they might lack.</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
Find an access to the system where we can hook up the air compressor. There has to be a hose bib or a drain somewhere after the main shutoff valve where the compressor hose can be attached. It will probably be the same drain used in the previous step. Make sure all the other drains are closed (if you opened them in the previous step) except for the drain where the hose will be attached. Sometimes you have to use a little ingenuity to make up a fitting to attach the air hose to the drain. It's not usually a standard fitting (unless you're really lucky).</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
Prior to hooking up the air hose to the irrigation system let the air compressor charge itself. Usually most compressors can charge up to 120 psi or more. However you do not need that much pressure to blow out a system. Actually never blow out an irrigation system with more than 80 psi. Be warned anything over 80 psi can damage the components of the irrigation system. A good rule of thumb is to use the same amount of pressure used for the house water pressure often around 60 psi. This will avoid any risks of using too much pressure.</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
Now hook up the compressor and start winterizing. It's best to start with the zone furthest away and work your way back to the nearest zone. Or start on the zone at the highest elevation point usually on top of a berm or hill. For this example let's assume that zone number 10 is the furthest away. We turn zone number 10 on at the controller for 2 minutes and let it go. Now 2 minutes might be too long or not long enough. Watch the water as it comes out of the sprinkler heads. Slowly the water will turn into a mist then the mist will turn into air. At this point all the air is out of zone number 10. Turn off zone number 10 and continue on to the next zone.</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
Please note you usually do not have to get every single drop of water out of the system. If you continue to blow out the system (even though all the water is out) heat from the air could damage the components of the irrigation system. It's better to get the majority of water out but not continuously run the compressor striving to get every drop of water out. A little residual water left in the zone will not hurt.</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
It is recommended that you blow out each zone twice with two short cycles as opposed to blowing out each zone once with a long cycle. This reduces your margin of error because there is less of a chance that the compressor was left on too long or a zone was missed.</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
Next we have to check the backflow preventer. Most systems have a backflow prevention device installed at the beginning of the system. Make sure it's completely void of water. You most likely we blew air through it in the previous steps. Open all the drains and leave them open. Over the winter it's best to leave the ball valves or drains (on the backflow preventer) at a 45-degree angle. Sometimes condensation can build up inside the ball valve cracking it when the temperature drops below the freezing point. Leaving the ball valves at a 45-degree angle will help prevent this.</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
The average residential system should take about 30 to 45 minutes to winterize. But this could fluctuate depending on the size of the compressor being used and the size of the irrigation system. Obviously there are many more scenarios that can add to the winterization process. Pumps fertilizer injectors etc. could all add to the winterization process.</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
Remember ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" This definitely applies to winterizing an irrigation system. Knowing that your customer's irrigation systems will start and operate without any headaches in the spring is definitely worth a pound of cure.</div>

<p>Contractors who work on commercial properties know that stormwater regulations have been a part of the conversation for decades. But as water management becomes a higher priority for local communities and homeowners it&#39;s a topic contractors working in the residential space must consider.</p>

<p>Some industry experts estimate that 97% of all existing homes have a recognizable stormwater management issue but only 30% of those issues are addressed. This means a large business opportunity exists for landscape contractors to offer stormwater management services.</p>

<p>Getting into the business isn&#39;t difficult; however it&#39;s important to be knowledgeable. Many homeowners start stormwater management projects but most aren&#39;t completed for two reasons:</p>

<ol style=""list-style-type:decimal"">
	<li>The homeowner thinks the cost is too high or the contractor wasn&#39;t trained to do the work.</li>
	<li>The problem is ignored or perceived as solved because it stops raining</li>
</ol>

<p>Here&#39;s what landscape contractors need to know to begin offering stormwater management services and address this significant customer need.</p>

<p><strong>Understand What Projects Create a Stormwater Management Need</strong><br />
Typically any project that increases the impervious area of a landscape could trigger local stormwater management regulations. Know that any project that changes the landscape could also alter the existing water flow and create an opportunity for water management work.</p>

<p><strong>Know the Local Regulations</strong><br />
There are currently no federal regulations on residential stormwater management. Most if not all regulations exist at the local level. Check with your local issuing authority to ask about regulations regarding permeability.</p>

<p><strong>Gain Knowledge</strong><br />
NDS a leading supplier of water drainage solutions offers an excellent video series on water management and that&#39;s a great place to start. Once you have a basic understanding SiteOne offers water management courses as part of <a href=""/events"">SiteOne University</a> available through local SiteOne stores. Courses are available in the off-season and come to you courses may be available to larger contractors.</p>

<p><strong>Prepare for the Busy Season</strong><br />
The busiest season for stormwater management aligns with a region&#39;s rainy season or spring thaw. This will vary depending on your area of the country. Contractors should consider adding water management to all their projects to eliminate unanticipated problems caused by improvements in the landscape.</p>

<p><strong>Gear Up</strong><br />
One of the best parts about stormwater management services is that special tools aren&#39;t required. Most contractors already have what they need. Of course excavators and trenching machines can speed up larger jobs but this equipment can be rented at a reasonable cost.</p>

<p>New irrigation controller technologies are allowing administrators (homeowners contractors and maintenance personnel) unprecedented control over their systems. While an estimated 20 million+ US homes have irrigation systems installed many are out of date. For irrigation contractors this means the controller replacement market is quite large. </p><p>Wi-Fi-enabled controllers are relatively new to the market and in many ways are an extension of the smart home trend. Products available from Hunter Rain Bird Toro Hydro-Rain and Rachio offer an array of solutions for contractors where they can install homeowner-managed systems or manage these systems themselves as part of their service offering.</p><p>The benefits of replacing older controller models with new Wi-Fi-enabled models are clear:</p><h3>Refined Programming:</h3><p>Enhanced and remote programming options give users unprecedented control over their system which allows them to monitor and adjust their systems via their smart phone laptop or tablet.</p><h3>Smart Water Application:</h3><p>Smart technology saves water – up to 50% – and money by making predictive automatic watering adjustments. These adjustments can be based on local weather events and forecasts which may be automatically transmitted from local weather stations to individual controllers. Contractors and homeowners can also utilize on-site rain and moisture sensors that will further improve a systems efficiency.</p><h3>Easy Troubleshooting:</h3><p>For some models troubleshooting a system is much easier by providing flow monitoring that can alert the user to broken pipes and damaged sprinklers. It can also provide information on electrical currents to help detect broken or damaged wires and solenoids.</p><p>The opportunity and benefits are clear. Offering controller replacement services to your clients can be profitable in terms of installation revenue but also from a management and efficiency standpoint. So what do you need to know to get started?</p><h3>When to Recommend an Upgrade to the System</h3><p>Any system that doesn’t include the smart technology mentioned above is a good candidate for replacement. To gain Wi-Fi connectivity most controllers must be replaced entirely. Based on the water savings which may be achieved with proper installation and use most homeowners can recoup the cost of the controller in a relatively short period of time.</p><h3>How to Sell the Benefits</h3><p>For homeowners planning to manage their own systems the benefits are simple. A Wi-Fi-enabled controller allows them the manage their system from virtually anywhere and offers advanced automation features that allow them to save water and money with less effort. For homeowners with contractor-managed services it offers all the same savings while providing the opportunity for more accurate troubleshooting and fewer costly site visits from their landscape contractor.</p><h3>Technical Knowledge</h3><p>The good news is like all controllers Wi-Fi-enabled products come with detailed instructions for installation programming and management. Similar to other technological advances such as smart phones the systems are intuitive and relatively simple to install. But if you need help finding the right product or advice on comparing features SiteOne associates can always be of assistance.</p><p>Contact your local SiteOne representative to get more information about the business opportunities in irrigation controller replacement.

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>Adding Holiday Lighting to Your Services Menu? Consider This.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">With Halloween comes the official start to the holiday season.&nbsp;For many landscape contractors this season historically signals a slow down for business; however, for contractors willing to get creative with services there is still work to be done.&nbsp;One example of creative services to offer your customers in the winter months is <a href=""/en/lighting-holiday/c/sh1113"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">holiday landscape lighting</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>Components of Holiday Lighting Projects</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">The first step to successfully marketing this service to your customers is to understand the major components of holiday lighting projects.&nbsp;At a high level, most projects will require you to identify the light strands, bulbs, connection tools/clips and any specialty holiday lights (e.g., icicle, trunk, and net lights) required to achieve the look that your customer wants.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Depending on the size of your customer&#39;s budget, holiday accessories like wreaths, garlands, and bows can also be specified to emphasize large specimen trees and architectural elements like archways, walls, and fencing.&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re just starting to offer holiday lighting services it&rsquo;s important to be mindful of the clients you&rsquo;re targeting when making lighting suggestions.&nbsp;Matching your suggestions to the scope of their budget will increase the likelihood of converting your prospect into a paying customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Luckily technological developments with <a href=""/en/lighting-holiday/c/sh1113?q=%3Arelevance%3Asocategory%3ASH1113102%3AlghtLightingTechnology%3ALED&amp;searchtype=product&amp;viewtype=All&amp;Technology=on"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">LED holiday lights</a> and the availability of wireless and smart lighting controllers reduce the operating costs of displays significantly.&nbsp;This can be sold to the customer as a benefit of having a professional with access to these products and tools complete their installation.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>Lighting Safety Considerations</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Most holiday lighting projects can be completed by non-specialty crews fairly easily, but there is some degree of education required around electricity and amp loading for larger jobs.&nbsp;Safety should also be top of mind in areas where winter weather is a factor early in the season.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s much better to prevent cold temperature related injuries using <a href=""https://www.siteone.com/en/tools-equipment-safety-safety/c/sh1712"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">personal protective equipment</a> like gloves, properly sized and reinforced ladders, non-slip work boots and eyewear than to face the effects of an ill-prepared team.</p>

<p>Meeting with an accountant or CPA to discuss how the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is impacting business needs to be a top priority. Why? Because billions of dollars in government emergency financial aid are rapidly being applied and awarded to small business owners to manage the economic damage from the pandemic. The rate at which small business owners are applying for these forgivable loans has been called &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo; which is why lawmakers are working to earmark additional funding. However, there is uncertainty around if and when funds will come through, making now the best time to speak with a business advisor and apply.</p>

<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Below are five programs to talk with an accountant about now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is The CARES Act?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES)</a> Act is a more than $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at providing immediate relief to U.S. citizens. In addition to providing individual checks, funds are earmarked to keep businesses operating.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>How Do I Keep Payroll Flowing?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)</a> gives qualified small businesses up to eight weeks financial help to maintain payroll, hire back employees that may have had to be laid off and certain overhead items. The SBA will forgive PPP loans if &ldquo;<em>all employees are kept on the payroll for eight weeks and the money is used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest or utilities (due to likely high subscription, at least 75-percent of the forgiven amount must be used for payroll)</em>&rdquo;. Qualified institutions are able to process PPP loans. Once a lender is identified, download and complete the <a href=""https://www.sba.gov/document/sba-form--paycheck-protection-program-borrower-application-form"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">Paycheck Protection Program Form</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Important: The Paycheck Protection Program will be available through June 30, 2020. </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the SBA,<strong> small business eligible for PPP </strong>must be:</p>

<ul style=""list-style-type:circle"">
	<li><em>Any small business concern that meets SBA&rsquo;s size standards (either the industry based sized standard or the alternative size standard)</em></li>
	<li><em>Any business, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, 501(c)(19) veterans organization, or Tribal business concern (sec. 31(b)(2)(C) of the Small Business Act) with the greater of:</em>
	<ul style=""list-style-type:circle"">
		<li><em>500 employees, or</em></li>
		<li><em>That meets the SBA industry size standard if more than 500</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><em>Any business with a NAICS Code that begins with 72 (Accommodations and Food Services) that has more than one physical location and employs less than 500 per location</em></li>
	<li><em>Sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed persons</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>Is Immediate Financial Aid Available?</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the PPP, the <a href=""https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/economic-injury-disaster-loan-emergency-advance"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Advance</a> (EIDL) Emergency Advance is designed to provide an emergency advance of up to $10,000. There may be stipulations around how these monies can be utilized, so it is important to discuss in detail with an advisor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>Is Long Term Emergency Funding Available? </strong></p>

<p>The EIDL also provides up to $2 million in loans. Talk with a commercial banking advisor about applying for additional funding through EIDL.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Are There Other Debt Relief Options? </strong><br />
For businesses that had a current <a href=""https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/sba-debt-relief"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">SBA Service Disaster (Home and Business) Loan</a>, it is possible that there is additional help. According to the SBA, if a loan was in &ldquo;regular servicing&rdquo; status on March 1, 2020, the administration is providing automatic deferments through December 31, 2020. Discuss specific details with the assigned a disaster loan officer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is nothing worse&nbsp;than having the Internal Revenue Service or another taxing authority chasing&nbsp;after you. However, as a taxpayer, you have&nbsp;rights, including the right to&nbsp;consult a lawyer. This article is in no way intended to serve as legal advice,&nbsp;and you should consult an attorney if you are&nbsp;facing a tax audit.<br />
<br />
Look for an attorney&nbsp;who will provide customized solutions for difficult tax problems. When it comes&nbsp;to taxes, one size doesn&rsquo;t fit all, and you should find an attorney who will not only minimize the taxes you owe within the tax laws, but also reduce your stress by taking the weight of dealing with the IRS on a day-to-day basis off your shoulders.<br />
<br />
When you receive an&nbsp;audit notice from the IRS, your first reaction may be panic, but you need to&nbsp;assert yourself and let the IRS know that you are&nbsp;confident in your return. One&nbsp;of the quickest ways to regain your confidence is to set some ground rules for&nbsp;your audit. First, you have every right to&nbsp;establish the day and location of&nbsp;your audit. This will give you the necessary time to prepare. Second, you can educate&nbsp;yourself as to your liability and&nbsp;limit the audit to include just those issues&nbsp;relevant to the reason for the audit.<br />
<br />
Next, know your stuff.&nbsp;Were you aware that you can claim a deduction without a receipt or cancelled&nbsp;check? While we&rsquo;ve all been led to believe that you must have a receipt or canceled check to claim a deduction, few people realize that personal testimony may be enough to claim a deduction. If you have all the facts in order, reconstructed records, affadavits and other proof are valuable tools that can help you claim deductions when the original records are unavailable.<br />
<br />
Plus, in an audit the&nbsp;IRS may need you to authorize them to do certain thing&mdash;extend the time they&nbsp;have to collect a tax from you, for instance. Don&#39;t&nbsp;agree to anything unless&nbsp;your attorney agrees.<br />
<br />
Last, remember that an&nbsp;IRS auditor has no power to do anything without your permission; they cannot increase or decrease your tax liability, charge you with penalties or seize your assets. And, you have the Right of Appeal. Reminding your auditor that you know this may help you maintain control and pay only the taxes you owe.<br />
<br />
So, when you receive an&nbsp;audit notice from the IRS, remember, don&#39;t panic, contact an attorney, and know&nbsp;your rights. These three simple steps will&nbsp;help you maintain control and reduce&nbsp;the stress that comes with the notice.</p>

<p>Marketing effectiveness builds over time. Being in the market with a consistent and dependable message, while delivering superior service and a dependable product, will generate a new business referral for your company. Word-of-mouth marketing is the best referral you can get. You can dramatically lower your advertising and marketing costs, raise your prices and help your business grow by building a successful word-of-mouth marketing program into your business.</p>

<p>To improve your company&#39;s word-of-mouth marketing program, gain a stronger grasp on the transactional costs your business incurs to generate a referral. Review the hidden costs your current accounting system might not be measuring. For example:</p>

<ul>

<p>All companies big and small face the challenge of handling the complexities of employees. From hiring to terminating here are some proven methods for managing your employees.</p><h3>Expanding Your Business</h3><p>Many landscape companies rely on several day laborers to help with trenching installing pipe and heads and other routine tasks at residential jobs. But suppose these laborers are not irrigation experts. If you want to expand your business you have to add a project manager or site foreman who is up-to-date on installation techniques and new products and can also handle sales calls estimates and purchasing.</p><h3>The Pros and Cons</h3><p>The idea of having others to help you grow your business is often the first step to success. But you should first consider all of the pros and cons of having employees:</p><ul><li>Is there enough work to justify another person on the job full-time? Can you forecast the need for this person in the future?</li><li>Do you have the time necessary to recruit and train a new person?</li><li>Do you have the tools equipment and vehicles necessary to properly furnish the new employee?</li><li>Where should you look for new employees?</li><li>Have you considered all of the financial aspects including salary insurance taxes benefits etc.?</li><li>Can one of your existing employees handle more responsibilities?</li></ul><p>Promoting from within increases morale. The most important decision is whether this person will add significant income to your business. You might decide that an additional skilled employee will cut down on your workload. However when you figure in salary insurance equipment and the loss of time needed to train a new employee you may discover that it would not be a prudent business decision until you can count on a consistent pattern of steady jobs.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Five Rules of Recruiting</h3><p>Taking the time to locate good employees will often cut down on many of the problems you will encounter later. If you hire the right person now you can avoid unnecessary training warnings employee frustrations terminations and rehiring. Here are the five rules of recruiting a dependable competent long-term employee:</p><ol type=""1""><li>Locate an employee with professional skills and training. The Irrigation Association and local contractor associations often sponsor training programs. Some local colleges may have courses of study in irrigation irrigation system design horticulture turf grass management etc. and can recommend knowledgeable people.</li><li>Carefully review employment history. Long-term employees cut down on costs associated with training new paperwork and rehiring. Check all available references. Ask specifics about performance reliability and experience.</li><li>Note your first impression since it will probably be the same as your customer's. If it's good this will reflect well on your business.</li><li>Interview good candidates at least three times. You'll get a slightly different view each time. If all three are positive this candidate is probably a winner.</li><li>Find someone genuinely interested in your business. Past experience self-study and general knowledge will produce a more secure long-term employee.</li></ol></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Locating Qualified Workers</h3><p>Finding the right person also depends on where you look. While you can follow the general rule of classified advertising, there are better ways to find talented people:</p><ul><li>Make current employees aware of all job openings with detailed job qualifications, time frame and salary range.</li><li>Follow up recommendations from your peers in the industry.</li><li>Advertise through local landscape professional and community associations. These organizations often include individuals who can make good employees. You might also recruit through community colleges. Test out your needs and the employee's skills by first hiring them an as intern, and then later as a full-time employee.</li></ul></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Hiring Employees</h3><p>The best advice in hiring is to follow the rules and don't cut corners. Properly and completely fill out all necessary payroll paperwork and make the employee fully aware of the job requirements company guidelines reporting structure salary and benefits. Your accountant or attorney can give you tips on this. The more an employee knows at the start the more secure they will feel about all aspects of their job. For your protection have the employee sign a document indicating that they have received all of the necessary paperwork.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Tips on Immigrant Workers</h3><p>If you are hiring immigrant workers it is essential that you learn and follow the regulations for their employment. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) maintains a toll-free number (800-870-3676) where you can order copies of the M274 Handbook and forms.Even if you are careful to follow the guidelines you cannot always be certain that your employees are doing the same. The INS has been known to conduct all-out raids on established firms with agents and police officers taking workers into custody. Although the contracting firm may be in full compliance the documentation of their employees may be fraudulent.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Recognition and Training</h3><p>Now that you've located and hired the ideal employee it is important to keep them happy and in full support of your company. In addition to adequate pay bonuses and incentives there are several other ways you can show employees that you value them and their work.</p><ul><li>Recognition is an inexpensive yet highly effective method for improving morale and increasing production. Heartfelt thanks for a job well done certificates of achievement increased responsibilities employee contests and short notes on special occasions improve the self-worth of the employee.</li><li>Training is also good for morale while giving the employee a chance to spread their wings. If you can offer money or at least time off for professional seminars college reimbursements trade show attendance or even in-house seminars your employees will appreciate your commitment to them. Distributors like SiteOne offer continuous training programs for professionals and their employees.</li><li>Family-oriented companies have proven to have more long-term employees. Company events foster a feeling of togetherness and belonging. In-house programs that support the family such as early-leave days schedule flexibility and even telephone time help the employee to better integrate the company into their daily lives.</li></ul></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<h3>Termination Suggestions</h3><p>For those unfortunate times when the employee does not fulfill the requirements of the job termination is a necessary evil in the course of your management. Again following the rules is important for legal reasons as well as for the employee.</p><ul><li>Review the legal issues associated with termination. Put warnings in writing and be detailed about the infraction its occurrences and the proper rules. Give the employee a chance to correct the problem with your guidance within a specific time period.</li><li>Keep the termination time to a minimum by stating the problem calmly and completely and then moving on to the next steps. It is important not to argue with the employee.</li><li>Have all of the paperwork ready for the employee to sign upon termination. Give the employee paperwork that describes insurance unemployment pension funds and any other issues. Your accountant or attorney can be helpful with these matters.</li><li>Make short suggestions for alternate employment.</li><li>Help the employee leave the premises with dignity by allowing them to take personal belongings say goodbye and leave quickly and without incident.</li></ul><p>Finding hiring keeping or terminating employees is all a part of the continuous process of building your business. While there are several difficult steps involved in each area you can learn how to maximize your effectiveness and make your company stronger as you continue to grow.</p></div>

<p>After working with a challenging customer, it can be all too easy to say, this business would be great if it weren't for the customers. Except that it wouldn't.</p><p>Never mind the fact that customers are necessary to the green industry business model, without them there wouldn't be anyone to appreciate the hard-earned beauty of that new hardscape patio, water feature, lighting installation or backyard makeover.</p><p>Happy customers are more than necessary, you could argue that they mean everything to your business. So here are a few tips to keep your customers happy and create repeat and referral business.</p><h3>Set expectations from the start</h3><p>Your crew was hired because the client has something specific in mind. It's important to clearly understand what they want and clearly communicate how you can deliver. If there are any limitations to the project scope such as budget, materials, best practices, etc. now is the time to bring that up. Setting expectations from the start will reduce the potential for headaches and heartburn later on.</p><h3>Operate by the book</h3><p>Following best practices every time is not only good business, it's good customer service. Get signatures on all contracts and change orders, and ensure that all involved understand clearly what they're approving. This goes a long way toward communicating professionalism and integrity as a contractor.</p><h3>Manage personalities</h3><p>Whether it's a client or crewmember, try to anticipate personality conflicts before they arise. Pair your most detail-oriented crew with the pickiest clients, and identify specific customers who may need to call you directly instead of going through the front office. Balance these scales properly and the benefits will be significant.</p><p>While these tips might seem basic, when your crew is busiest is when the fundamentals can start to slip. Suddenly missteps on the easiest tasks can cause the biggest headaches. Too many missteps too often starts to become your reputation. So, it pays to stay vigilant on the basics of customer service.</p><p>To learn more about continuing education opportunities for green industry professionals through SiteOne visit the News and Events <link to News and Events> section of our website or speak with an expert at your local SiteOne branch <link to branch locator>.</p></div>

<p>Begin to approach any sales situation first based on what you know is right. Simply try to present the inalienable truths that exist for the service(s) you provide. For instance with sprinkler irrigation we know that high pressure can wreak havoc on systems. We know that different soils soil textures slopes and climates dramatically influence our ability to deliver the right uniformity of water. We know that design spacing wind and climate all are extremely important factors for a golf course superintendent to consider if he or she is going to be successful in the turfgrass management of their course. Yet when you look at the products and techniques being used today in golf course applications and compare them to the basic truths that exist in irrigation you begin to understand that how we are approaching irrigation systems is the way that the world tells us we must instead of stopping and saying.Let's do what's right and truly in the best interest of the customer.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Often during the busy season, we hear from valued professional irrigation contractors .I can't handle another lead, or I can't get back to people, it's just too busy. In all, these are customer service situations. We need to start by believing that any action we take transpires because it's the right thing to do: calling a customer back fast, letting a customer know you appreciate their business, and developing solutions to a customer's problem. If we let the forces around us dictate how we act, react and handle situations, then we will always have a crutch to lean upon. However, if we start with basic principles of what we know is right, and then we pursue what is right with a specific end in mind, we will enjoy greater success, profitability and maintain the long-term value of our enterprises.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>Pursuing what is right in your sales efforts and taking upon yourself a consultative selling role can help you increase your profits. Perhaps the biggest reason why is that you are approaching the situation from the customer's perspective trying to determine what the customer wants and the best possible way to deliver the right solution. If you believe that every job must first be approached from the price perspective then you're putting yourself in a position where the only way to win is by lowering your price to the detriment of your bottom line. You've stopped searching for customer solutions.</p><p>A very simple example is two professional irrigation contractors bidding on the same job. The first contractor makes a presentation based on making sure I'm priced competitive to get the job. By not even pursuing with the customer the ways things could be or should be the first contractor simply explains that he'll just have the rotors which water the turf spray onto the flowers and the customer will get the same job done at a lower cost. The second contractor takes a moment or two and tells the homeowner the way things could be done and how when those things are done right the customer will be able to have more control over the irrigation system healthier plants and turf and a better irrigation system. The second contractor in this real example got the job for a significantly higher price. Once the customer was shown and explained how things could be and that for a few dollars more they were able to get a system that did the job right the consultative sales process was complete.</p></div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p>As sprinkler irrigation continues to reach a larger slice of the American population pie every year the pressures to provide more at lower cost gains momentum. It is in our interest the customer’s interest and the industry’s interest to put more emphasis on consultative selling. In the example of irrigation systems they are not only hard work to install but it takes knowledge and expertise to design and install them based on what is right.</p><p>Evaluate your sales process and the products and services you offer your customers. Are you providing and implementing what you know is right or are you forgetting to take into account if you are doing what is in the best interest of your customers?</p></div>

<p><strong>Here to Help You Provide Essential Services to Your Customers</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SiteOne&reg; Landscape Supply is committed to helping you manage your business during and after the pandemic globally known as COVID-19. While millions are sheltering in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus disease, thousands of workers including landscape contractors, remain called to the job. On March 28, 2020, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security updated the &ldquo;Advisory Memorandum on Identification of Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers During COVID-19 Response&rdquo; to clearly identify landscapers as essential workers. (Security, 2020)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><em>&ldquo;Workers such as plumbers, electricians, exterminators, builders, contractors, HVAC Technicians, landscapers, and other service providers that are necessary to maintaining the safety, sanitation and essential operation of residences, businesses and buildings such as hospitals, senior living facilities, any temporary construction required to support COVID-19 response&rdquo;. </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">This is an ever-changing situation, and some governors are putting mandates on what is classified as &ldquo;essential&rdquo; and what is not. We encourage you to frequently check the <a href=""https://www.landscapeprofessionals.org/Coronavirus/State_by_State_COVID_Guidance.aspx"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">National Association of Landscape Professionals (NALP) list of state by state guidance</a>&nbsp;and follow the state law.</p>

<p>Our branches are operating and are in full compliance with the safety guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). To further support social distancing, we encourage customers to enroll in <a href=""/login"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">SiteOne&rsquo;s Staged portal</a> &ndash; this gives you the power to place your order for seed, fertilizer, irrigation, et. al. Staged so that it is ready to load when you arrive at your branch or have it delivered to the jobsite.</p>
</div>
<div class=""cl""></div>
<div class=""col-md-7 row article-detail-content"">
<p><strong>Why Are We Essential Services?</strong></p>

<p>We all know that services performed by landscape contractors go well beyond the obvious weekly maintenance of lawns and flower beds. And like the Department of Homeland Security, most state, provincial and local governments agree that your services are necessary for the continued maintenance and safety of residential communities, commercial properties and municipalities. This includes your key role in essential infrastructure projects like public works and construction. These are jobs that mitigate potentially life-threatening issues such as:</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">&middot; Disease that thrives in water</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">&middot; Pests like mosquitoes, fleas and ticks</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">&middot; Fungicides in the soil</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">&middot; Trees and limbs that can fall during or after spring or summer storms</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">&middot; Snow and ice hazards</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And as the weather warms in the United States, these services are needed. Additionally, a study from the University of Washington / USDA Forest Service (Wolf, 2014) shows that plants have mental health benefit; specifically, plants and gardens have the power to:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&middot; Reduce anxiety and depression</p>

<p>&middot; Improve mental clarity</p>

<p>&middot; Increase physical activity</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Going to work every day to perform landscaping services, whether it is mowing, fertilizing, weed control, hazard mitigation, spraying for insects, pruning trees and bushes or planting new plants can help your customers to manage the marathon that is COVID-19 in the safe and secure place that is their living area.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong>What Should You Do During This Timeframe? </strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make your employees and customers safety your top priority. In addition to practicing social distancing, make sure your workplace and employees are following recommendations outlined by OSHA:</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">&middot; Promote frequent and thorough handwashing with running water and soap. If water and soap aren&rsquo;t available, provide an alcohol-based (at least 60-percent alcohol) hand sanitizer.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">&middot; Encourage social distancing by reducing the number of people in one vehicle. Perhaps have crews meet at a jobsite rather than carpooling to one location.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">&middot; Promote the use of covering coughs and sneezes.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">&middot; Reinforce that workers need to stay at home if they are feeling ill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arm crews with guidance. We encourage you to print a letter written for state and local officials by the National Association of Landscape Professionals (NALP) further communicating that landscapers are essential to the health and well-being of the community. Click <a href=""https://blog.landscapeprofessionals.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Landscape-Essential-Services-Letter-3_20_20.pdf?_zs=kX7Ah1&amp;_zl=2Nic6"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">here</a>&nbsp;to download the letter, print it and give it to each worker to carry on their person or in their vehicle.</p>
