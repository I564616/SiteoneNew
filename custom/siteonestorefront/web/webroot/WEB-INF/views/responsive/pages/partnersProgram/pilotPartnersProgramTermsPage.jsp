				<li class="marginTop10">The SiteOne Partners Program (the "Program") is a customer
					loyalty program available to certain customers of SiteOne Landscape
					Supply, LLC or its affiliates ("SiteOne"). Information collected by
					SiteOne in connection with Program enrollment is subject to the
					SiteOne Privacy Policy, which is available for review at
					SiteOne.com/Privacy. Program members are encouraged to review the
					SiteOne Privacy Policy prior to enrolling in the Program.</li>

				<li class="marginTop10">Participation in the Program is subject to these Program
					Terms and Conditions (the "Terms and Conditions"), which may be
					amended without prior notice by SiteOne from time to time. Current
					Terms and Conditions are posted at SiteOne.com. Failure to abide by
					the Terms and Conditions, abuse of Program privileges, conduct
					detrimental to the interests of SiteOne, or any misrepresentation
					made to SiteOne in connection with the Program may result in the
					termination of Program participation and forfeiture of accumulated
					points, each in SiteOne's sole discretion.</li>

				<li class="marginTop10">Eligibility is limited to professional landscape and/or
					irrigation, lawn care, maintenance and pest management companies
					headquartered in the United States and Canada. For the purposes of
					these Terms and Conditions, the term "Program member" shall mean
					and include a corporation, partnership, limited liability company
					or sole proprietorship that is eligible for and enrolled in the
					Program. Only one Program member may be maintained per company. In
					the case of a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor must be at
					least 21 years of age to become a Program member. Certain customers
					may be ineligible to participate in the Program, as determined by
					SiteOne in its sole discretion, including but not limited to
					product resellers, retail customers and national accounts
					customers.</li>
				<li class="marginTop10">The following accounts may not be eligible for certain
					benefits of the Program:
					<ol type="i">
						<li class="marginTop10">Government accounts may be eligible to participate in the
							Program on a limited basis (where permitted by law). Limitations
							on participation by government accounts may include only using
							points for continuing education events or account credit. If a
							government account does not elect to use accumulated points
							during a calendar year, such points may be deducted from the
							account and an account credit will be provided.</li>
						<li class="marginTop10">Golf customers do not qualify to (a) enroll in our
							"Business Solutions" rewards offered by the Program or (b) attend
							trips that may be offered as awards by the Program.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li class="marginTop10">If a Program member elects to unenroll in the Program or
					cancel its Program account, points will no longer be earned under
					the Program and any unused points will be forfeited and unusable.
					Additionally, upon unenrollment or cancellation by a Program
					member, such member will not be eligible for re-enrollment in the
					Program within the same calendar year. Re-enrollment will not
					result in the recoupment of previously-forfeited points.</li>

				<li class="marginTop10">Only one Program account shall be maintained per Program
					member and points are not transferable between Program members.
					Each Program member must designate one contact person ("Contact
					Person") for purposes of the Program. Each Program member shall be
					responsible or advising SiteOne of any changes to the Contact
					Person or address relating to its Program account.</li>

				<li class="marginTop10">SiteOne has sole authority in determining any company's
					eligibility to participate in the Program or whether the redemption
					of available points for any Program award is in accordance with
					these Terms and Conditions.</li>
				<li class="marginTop10">The Program will run annually from January 1 to December
					31. Program members will have until December 31 of the following
					calendar year to redeem points earned in the prior year. In the
					event that SiteOne elects to terminate the Program, Program members
					will have ninety (90) days after the termination date to redeem
					points if they comply with these Terms and Conditions.</li>

				<div class="row"><h2 class="headline2 row">EARNING POINTS</h2></div>
				<li class="marginTop10">Program members earn points by purchasing eligible products
					from a SiteOne branch location or SiteOne.com. Eligible products
					may be determined by SiteOne in its sole discretion and a change in
					product eligibility can happen at any time, with or without notice.
					Generally, Points do not accumulate for agency products.</li>
				<li class="marginTop10"> <strong>One (1) point will be posted to a Program member's
					points account for every One Dollar ($1.00) of eligible purchases,
					no fractional points will be awarded. No points will be awarded for
					taxes, delivery or other fees associated with the purchase of
					eligible products.</strong></li>
				<li class="marginTop10">Points earned by a Program member on purchase of products
					later returned will be deducted from the Program member's account.</li>
				<li class="marginTop10">Point Balance Structure. Points are redeemable during the
					calendar year they are earned, as "Available Points", and the
					calendar year after they are earned, as "Expiring Points". The
					points balance structure works as follows:

					<p>"Available Points" - points earned on fully paid invoices
						from eligible purchases in the current calendar year.</p>
					<p>"Expiring Points" - points earned on fully paid invoices
						from the previous calendar year. Expiring points that are not used
						by December 31 of the current calendar year will be forfeited.</p>
					<p>"Pending Points" - points from eligible but unpaid purchases
						in the current calendar year, and/or points earned on eligible
						purchases that will be unlocked once the $5,000 minimum is met.</p>
					<p>"Last Year Pending Points" - points from eligible but unpaid
						purchases in the previous calendar year that will move to the
						"Expiring Points" balance once paid in full.</p>
				</li>
				<div class="row"><h2 class="headline2 row">AWARD REDEMPTION</h2></div>
				<li class="marginTop10"><strong>To claim any award or redeem any points earned under the
					Program, the Program member must reach minimum purchases of Five
					Thousand Dollars ($5,000) during the calendar year of the Program.
					If the purchase level minimum is not met by close of business at
					the end of the Program year, all points will be forfeited. </strong>If the
					purchase level minimum is met, points earned during the Program
					year may be redeemed at any time until December 31 of the following
					year or, in the event of earlier termination of the Partners
					Program, points may be redeemed until ninety (90) days after the
					date of termination of the Program.</li>

					requirement for the applicable award. Points cannot be purchased
					with cash payments apart from product purchases</li>

				<li class="marginTop10">To claim an award or redeem points, a Program member's
					SiteOne accounts must be in good standing and paid in full. Program
					members' accounts payable to SiteOne must be paid in full to claim
					an award or redeem points, or otherwise gain any of benefits of the
					Program. SiteOne, at its sole discretion, may terminate a Program
					member's participation in the Program, and the availability of that
					Program member's points and benefits, if there is a past due
					balance of such member's SiteOne account over ninety (90) days. If
					a Program member's SiteOne account is past due over sixty (60)
					days, SiteOne, at its sole discretion, has the option of drawing
					upon the Program member's accrued points and converting them to
					credit to be applied against the member's outstanding balance of
					service charges and/or balance due. Points redeemed for this
					balance repayment will only be those available points earned
					through paid invoices.</li>

				<li class="marginTop10">An account's Contact Person may redeem available points for
					an award at any time during the Program year through December 31 of
					the following year or, in the event of earlier termination of the
					Program, the date that is ninety (90) days after the date of
					termination of the Program. Points can only be redeemed if an
					account is enrolled in the Program for the current year.</li>

				<li class="marginTop10">Each account's Contact Person is the only authorized and
					eligible person to claim an award or redeem points on behalf of
					such account. In the event that an unauthorized person or party
					claims or redeems points (or attempts to do any of the following)
					resulting in any loss to SiteOne or a Program member, the Program
					member shall release SiteOne Landscape Supply, LLC and its
					affiliates of any and all liability associated with such
					unauthorized access.</li>
				<li class="marginTop10">SiteOne, at its sole discretion, may determine a customer
					is not qualified to attend any SiteOne event that may be awarded or
					redeemed using Program points.</li>
				<li class="marginTop10">Any and all fees and taxes payable as a result of a
					member's participation in the Program are the sole responsibility
					of the participating Program member.</li>
